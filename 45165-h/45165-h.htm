<blockquote>

<p class="hang">BIRTH AND PARENTAGE&mdash;THE OLD HOUSE&mdash;RIDGEFIELD&mdash;THE MEETING-HOUSE&mdash;PARSON
MEAD&mdash;KEELER'S TAVERN&mdash;THE CANNON-BALL&mdash;LIEUTENANT
SMITH.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the western part of the State of Connecticut is a
small town named Ridgefield. This title is descriptive,
and indicates the general form and position of the place.
It is, in fact, a collection of hills, rolled into one general
and commanding elevation. On the west is a ridge of
mountains, forming the boundary between the States of
Connecticut and New York; to the south the land
spreads out in wooded undulations to Long Island
Sound; east and north, a succession of hills, some rising
up against the sky and others fading away in the distance,
bound the horizon. In this town, in an antiquated
and rather dilapidated house of shingles and clapboards,
I was born on the 19th of August, 1793.</p>

<p>My father, Samuel Goodrich, was minister of the Congregational
Church of that place, and there was no
other religious society and no other clergyman in the
town. He was the son of Elizur Goodrich, a distinguished
minister of the same persuasion at Durham,
Connecticut. Two of his brothers were men of eminence&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
late Chauncey Goodrich of Hartford, and
Elizur Goodrich of New Haven. My mother was a
daughter of John Ely, a physician of Saybrook, whose
name figures, not unworthily, in the annals of the revolutionary
war.</p>

<p>I was the sixth child of a family of ten children, two
of whom died in infancy, and eight of whom lived to be
married and settled in life. My father's annual salary
for the first twenty-five years, and during his ministry at
Ridgefield, averaged four hundred dollars a-year: the
last twenty-five years, during which he was settled at
Berlin, near Hartford, his stipend was about five hundred
dollars a-year. He was wholly without patrimony, and
owing to peculiar circumstances, which will be hereafter
explained, my mother had not even the ordinary outfit
when they began their married life. Yet they so
brought up their family of eight children, that they all
attained respectable positions in life, and at my father's
death he left an estate of four thousand dollars. These
facts throw light upon the simple annals of a country
clergyman in Connecticut, half-a-century ago; they also
bear testimony to the thrifty energy and wise frugality
of my parents, and especially of my mother, who was
the guardian deity of the household.</p>

<p>Ridgefield belongs to the county of Fairfield, and is
now a handsome town, as well on account of its artificial
as its natural advantages; with some two thousand inhabitants.
It is fourteen miles from Long Island Sound,
of which its many swelling hills afford charming views.
The main street is a mile in length, and is now embellished
with several handsome houses. About the
middle of it there is, or was, some forty years ago, a
white, wooden Meeting-house, which belonged to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
father's congregation. It stood in a small grassy square,
the favorite pasture of numerous flocks of geese, and the
frequent playground of school-boys, especially on Sunday
afternoons. Close by the front door ran the public road,
and the pulpit, facing it, looked out upon it on fair summer
Sundays, as I well remember by a somewhat
amusing incident.</p>

<p>In the contiguous town of Lower Salem dwelt an aged
minister, by the name of Mead. He was all his life
marked with eccentricity, and about those days of which
I speak, his mind was rendered yet more erratic by a
touch of paralysis. He was, however, still able to preach,
and on a certain Sunday, having exchanged with my
father, he was in the pulpit and engaged in making his
opening prayer. He had already begun his invocation,
when David P&mdash;&mdash;, who was the Jehu of that generation,
dashed by the front door upon a horse, a clever
animal, of which he was but too proud&mdash;in a full, round
trot. The echo of the clattering hoofs filled the church,
which, being of wood, was sonorous as a drum, and
arrested the attention, as well of the minister as the congregation,
even before the rider had reached it. The
minister was fond of horses, almost to frailty; and, from
the first, his practised ear perceived that the sounds came
from a beast of bottom. When the animal shot by the
door, he could not restrain his admiration; which was
accordingly thrust into the very marrow of his prayer
"We pray Thee, O Lord, in a particular and peculiar
manner&mdash;<em>that's a real smart critter</em>&mdash;to forgive us our
manifold trespasses, in a particular and peculiar manner,"
&amp;c.</p>

<p>I have somewhere heard of a traveller on horseback,
who, just at eventide, being uncertain of his road, inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of a person he chanced to meet, the way to
Barkhamstead.</p>

<p>"You are in Barkhamstead now," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Yes, but where is the centre of the place?"</p>

<p>"It hasn't got any centre."</p>

<p>"Well, but direct me to the tavern."</p>

<p>"There ain't any tavern."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the meeting-house?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you ask that afore? There it is, over
the hill!"</p>

<p>So, in those days, in Connecticut, as doubtless in
other parts of New England, the meeting-house was the
great geographical monument, the acknowledged meridian
of every town and village. Even a place without
a centre, or a tavern, had its house of worship; and this
was its point of reckoning. It was, indeed, something
more. It was the town-hall, where all public meetings
were held for civil purposes; it was the temple of religion,
the pillar of society, religious, social, and moral,
to the people around. It will not be considered strange,
then, if I look back to the meeting-house of Ridgefield,
as not only a most revered edifice, but as in some sense
the starting-point of my existence. Here, at least, linger
many of my most cherished remembrances.</p>

<p>A few rods to the south of this there was, and still is,
a tavern, kept in my day by Squire Keeler. This institution
ranked second only to the meeting-house; for the
tavern of those days was generally the centre of news,
and the gathering-place for balls, musical entertainments,
public shows, &amp;c.; and this particular tavern had special
claims to notice. It was, in the first place, on the great
thoroughfare of the day, between Boston and New
York; and had become a general and favorite stopping-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
for travellers. It was, moreover, kept by a hearty
old gentleman, who united in his single person the varied
functions of publican, postmaster, representative, justice
of the peace, and I know not what else. He, besides,
had a thrifty wife, whose praise was in all the land. She
loved her customers, especially members of Congress,
governors, and others in authority who wore powder and
white top-boots, and who migrated to and fro in the lofty
leisure of their own coaches. She was, indeed, a woman
of mark; and her life has its moral. She scoured and
scrubbed, and kept things going, until she was seventy
years old; at which time, during an epidemic, she was
threatened with an attack. She, however, declared that
she had not time to be sick, and kept on working; so
that the disease passed her by, though it made sad havoc
all around her, especially with more dainty dames who
had leisure to follow the fashion.</p>

<p>Besides all this, there was an historical interest attached
to Keeler's tavern; for, deeply imbedded in the
north-eastern corner-post, there was a cannon-ball, planted
there during the famous fight with the British in
1777. It was one of the chief historical monuments of
the town, and was visited by all curious travellers who
came that way. Little can the present generation imagine
with what glowing interest, what ecstatic wonder,
what big, round eyes, the rising generation of Ridgefield,
half a century ago, listened to the account of the fight,
as given by Lieutenant Smith, himself a witness of the
event and a participator in the conflict, sword in hand.</p>

<p>This personage, whom I shall have occasion again to
introduce to my readers, was, in my time, a justice of
the peace, town librarian, and general oracle in such
loose matters as geography, history, and law; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
about as uncertain and unsettled in Ridgefield, as is now
the longitude of Lilliput. He had a long, lean face;
long, lank, silvery hair; and an unctuous, whining
voice. With these advantages, he spoke with the authority
of a seer, and especially in all things relating to
the revolutionary war.</p>

<p>The agitating scenes of that event, so really great in
itself, so unspeakably important to the country, had
transpired some five-and-twenty years before. The existing
generation of middle age had all witnessed it;
nearly all had shared in its vicissitudes. On every hand
there were corporals, serjeants, lieutenants, captains, and
colonels, no strutting fops in militia buckram, raw blue
and buff, all fuss and feathers, but soldiers, men who had
seen service and won laurels in the tented field. Every
old man, every old woman, had stories to tell, radiant
with the vivid realities of personal observation or experience.
Some had seen Washington, and some Old
Put; one was at the capture of Ticonderoga under
Ethan Allen; another was at Bennington, and actually
heard old Stark say, "Victory this day, or my wife
Molly is a widow!" Some were at the taking of Stony
Point, and others in the sanguinary struggle of Monmouth.
One had witnessed the execution of André,
and another had been present at the capture of Burgoyne.
The time which had elapsed since these events
had served only to magnify and glorify these scenes, as
well as the actors, especially in the imagination of the
rising generation. If perchance we could now dig up
and galvanize into life a contemporary of Julius Cæsar,
who was present and saw him cross the Rubicon, and
could tell us how he looked and what he said, we should
listen with somewhat of the greedy wonder with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the boys of Ridgefield listened to Lieutenant Smith,
when of a Saturday afternoon, seated on the stoop of
Keeler's tavern, he discoursed upon the discovery of
America by Columbus, Braddock's defeat, and the old
French war; the latter a real epic, embellished with
romantic episodes of Indian massacres and captivities.
When he came to the Revolution, and spoke of the fight
at Ridgefield, and punctuated his discourse with a present
cannon-ball, sunk six inches deep in a corner-post of
the very house in which we sat, you may well believe it
was something more than words&mdash;it was, indeed, "action,
action, glorious action!" How little can people now-a-days
comprehend or appreciate these things!</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">THE NEW HOUSE&mdash;HIGH RIDGE&mdash;NATHAN KELLOGG'S SPY-GLASS&mdash;THE
SHOVEL&mdash;THE BLACK PATCH IN THE ROAD&mdash;DISTRUST OF BRITISH
INFLUENCE&mdash;OLD CHICH-ES-TER&mdash;AUNT DELIGHT&mdash;RETURN AFTER TWENTY
YEARS.</p></blockquote>


<p>My memory goes distinctly back to the year 1797,
when I was four years old. At that time a great event
happened&mdash;great in the narrow horizon of childhood:
we removed from the Old House to the New House!
This latter, situated on a road tending westward and
branching from the main street, my father had just built;
and it then appeared to me quite a stately mansion and
very beautiful, inasmuch as it was painted red behind and
white in front: most of the dwellings thereabouts being
of the dun complexion which pine-boards and chestnut-shingles
assume, from exposure to the weather. Long
after, having been absent twenty years, I revisited this
my early home, and found it shrunk into a very small and
ordinary two-story dwelling, wholly divested of its paint,
and scarcely thirty feet square.</p>

<p>This building, apart from all other dwellings, was
situated on what is called High Ridge, a long hill, looking
down upon the village, and commanding an extensive
view of the surrounding country. From our upper
windows, this was at once beautiful and diversified. On
the south, as I have said, the hills sloped in a sea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
undulations down to Long Island Sound, a distance of
some fourteen miles. This beautiful sheet of water, like
a strip of pale sky, with the island itself, more deeply
tinted, beyond, was visible in fair weather, for a stretch
of sixty miles, to the naked eye. The vessels, even the
smaller ones, sloops, schooners, and fishing-craft, could
be seen, creeping like insects over the surface. With a
spy-glass&mdash;and my father had one bequeathed to him by
Nathan Kellogg, a sailor, who made rather a rough voyage
of life, but anchored at last in the bosom of the
Church, as this bequest intimates&mdash;we could see the
masts, sails, and rigging. It was a poor, dim affair, compared
with modern instruments of the kind; but to me,
its revelations of an element which then seemed as
beautiful, as remote, and as mystical as the heavens, surpassed
the wonders of the firmament.</p>

<p>To the west, at a distance of three miles, lay the undulating
ridge of hills, cliffs, and precipices already mentioned,
and which bear the name of West Mountain.
They are some five hundred feet in height, and from our
point of view had an imposing appearance. Beyond
them, in the far distance, glimmered the peaks of the
highlands along the Hudson. These two prominent
features of the spreading landscape&mdash;the sea and the
mountain, ever present, yet ever remote&mdash;impressed themselves
on my young imagination with all the enchantment
which distance lends to the view. I have never
lost my first love. Never, even now, do I catch a glimpse
of either of these two rivals of nature, such as I first
learned them by heart, but I feel a gush of emotion as if
I had suddenly met with the cherished companions of
my childhood. In after days, even the purple velvet of
the Apennines and the poetic azure of the Mediterranean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
have derived additional beauty to my imagination from
mingling with these vivid associations of my childhood.</p>

<p>It was to the New House, then, thus situated, that
we removed, as I have stated, when I was four years old.
On that great occasion, everything available for draught
or burden was put in requisition; and I was permitted,
or required, I forget which, to carry the <i>peel</i>, as it was
then called, but which would now bear the title of
"shovel." Birmingham had not then been heard of in
those parts, or at least was a great way off; so this
particular utensil had been forged expressly for my father
by David Olmstead, the blacksmith, as was the custom in
those days. I recollect it well, and can state that it was
a sturdy piece of iron, the handle being four feet long,
with a knob at the end. As I carried it along, I doubtless
felt a touch of that consciousness of power which
must have filled the breast of Samson as he bore off the
gates of Gaza. I recollect perfectly well to have perspired
under the operation, for the distance of our migration
was half-a-mile, and the season was summer.</p>

<p>One thing more I remember: I was barefoot; and as
we went up the lane which diverged from the main road
to the house, we passed over a patch of earth blackened
by cinders, where my feet were hurt by pieces of melted
glass and metal. I inquired what this meant, and was
told that here a house was burned down by the British
troops already mentioned, and then in full retreat, as a
signal to the ships that awaited them in the Sound,
where they had landed, and where they intended to
embark.</p>

<p>This detail may seem trifling; but it is not without
significance. It was the custom in those days for boys
to go barefoot in the mild season. I recollect few things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in life more delightful than, in the spring, to cast away
my shoes and stockings, and have a glorious scamper
over the fields. Many a time, contrary to the express
injunctions of my mother, have I stolen this bliss; and
many a time have I been punished by a severe cold for
my disobedience. Yet the bliss then seemed a compensation
for the retribution. In these exercises I felt as
if stepping on air; as if leaping aloft on wings. I was
so impressed with the exultant emotions thus experienced,
that I repeated them a thousand times in happy dreams;
especially in my younger days. Even now these visions
sometimes come to me in sleep, though with a lurking
consciousness that they are but a mockery of the past;
sad monitors of the change which time has wrought upon
me.</p>

<p>As to the black patch in the lane, that, too, had its
meaning. The story of a house burned down by a
foreign army seized upon my imagination. Every time
I passed the place I ruminated upon it, and put a hundred
questions as to how and when it happened. I was
soon master of the whole story, and of other similar
events which had occurred all over the country. I was
thus initiated into the spirit of that day, and which has
never wholly subsided in our country; inasmuch as the
war of the Revolution was alike unjust in its origin, and
cruel as to the manner in which it was waged. It was,
moreover, fought on our own soil; thus making the
whole people share, personally, in its miseries. There
was scarcely a family in Connecticut whom it did not
visit, either immediately or remotely, with the shadows
of mourning and desolation. The British nation, to
whom this conflict was a foreign war, are slow to comprehend
the popular dislike of England, here in America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Could they know the familiar annals of our towns and
villages&mdash;burn, plundered, sacked&mdash;with all the attendant
horrors, for the avowed purpose of punishing a nation of
rebels, and those rebels of their own kith and kin: could
they be made acquainted with the deeds of those twenty
thousand Hessians, sent hither by King George, and who
have left their name in our language as a word signifying
brigands, who sell their blood and commit murder
for hire: could they thus read the history of minds and
hearts, influenced at the fountains of life for several
generations, they would perhaps comprehend, if they
could not approve, the habitual distrust of British influence,
which lingers among our people.</p>

<p>About three-fourths of a mile from my father's house,
on the winding road to Lower Salem, which I have
already mentioned, and which bore the name of West
Lane, was the school-house where I took my first lessons,
and received the foundations of my very slender education.
I have since been sometimes asked where I
graduated: my reply has always been, "At West Lane."
Generally speaking, this has ended the inquiry; whether,
because my questioners have confounded this venerable
institution with "Lane Seminary," or have not thought
it worth while to risk an exposure of their ignorance as
to the college in which I was educated, I am unable to
say.</p>

<p>The site of the school-house was a triangular piece of
land, measuring perhaps a rood in extent, and lying, according
to the custom of those days, at the meeting of
four roads. The ground hereabouts&mdash;as everywhere else
in Ridgefield&mdash;was exceedingly stony; and, in making
the pathway, the stones had been thrown out right and
left, and there remained in heaps on either side, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
generation to generation. All around was bleak and
desolate. Loose, squat stone walls, with innumerable
breaches, inclosed the adjacent fields. A few tufts of
elder, with here and there a patch of briers and pokeweed,
flourished in the gravelly soil. Not a tree, however,
remained; save an aged chestnut, at the western
angel of the space. This, certainly, had not been spared
for shade or ornament, but probably because it would
have cost too much labor to cut it down; for it was of
ample girth. At all events, it was the oasis in our desert
during summer; and in autumn, as the burrs disclosed
its fruit, it resembled a besieged city; the boys, like so
many catapults, hurled at it stones and sticks, until every
nut had capitulated.</p>

<p>Two houses only were at hand: one, surrounded by
an ample barn, a teeming orchard, and an enormous
wood-pile, belonging to Granther Baldwin; the other
was the property of "Old Chich-es-ter;" an uncouth,
unsocial being, whom everybody, for some reason or
other, seemed to despise and shun. His house was of
stone, and of one story. He had a cow, which every
year had a calf. He had a wife&mdash;dirty and uncombed,
and vaguely reported to have been brought from the old
country. This is about the whole history of the man, so
far as it is written in the authentic traditions of the
parish. His premises, an acre in extent, consisted of a
tongue of land between two of the converging roads.
No boy, that I ever heard of, ventured to cast a stone, or
to make an incursion into this territory, though it lay
close to the school-house. I have often, in passing,
peeped timidly over the walls, and caught glimpses of a
stout man with a drab coat, drab breeches, and drab gaiters,
prowling about the house; but never did I discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
him outside of his own dominion. I know it was darkly
intimated he had been tarred and feathered in the revolutionary
war; but as to the rest, he was a perfect myth.</p>

<p>The school-house itself consisted of rough, unpainted
clapboards, upon a wooden frame. It was plastered
within, and contained two apartments, a little entry,
taken out of a corner for a wardrobe, and the school-room
proper. The chimney was of stone, and pointed
with mortar, which, by the way, had been dug into a
honeycomb by uneasy and enterprising penknives. The
fireplace was six feet wide and four feet deep. The flue
was so ample and so perpendicular, that the rain, sleet,
and snow fell directly to the hearth. In winter, the
battle for life with green fizzling fuel, which was brought
in lengths and cut up by the scholars, was a stern one.
Not unfrequently the wood, gushing with sap as it was,
chanced to go out, and as there was no living without
fire, the thermometer being ten or twenty degrees below
zero, the school was dismissed, whereat all the scholars
rejoiced aloud, not having the fear of the schoolmaster
before their eyes.</p>

<p>It was the custom at this place to have a woman's
school in the summer months, and this was attended
only by young children. It was, in fact, what we now
call a primary or infant school. In winter, a man was
employed as teacher, and then the girls and boys of the
neighborhood, up to the age of eighteen, or even twenty,
were among the pupils. It was not uncommon, at this
season, to have forty scholars crowded into this little
building.</p>

<p>I was about six years old when I first went to school.
My teacher was Aunt Delight, that is Delight Benedict,
a maiden lady of fifty, short and bent, of sallow complexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and solemn aspect. I remember the first day
with perfect distinctness. I went alone&mdash;for I was
familiar with the road, it being that which passed by our
old house. I carried a little basket, with bread and butter
within, for my dinner, and this was covered over with
a white cloth. When I had proceeded about half way,
I lifted the cover, and debated whether I would not eat
my dinner then. I believe it was a sense of duty only
that prevented my doing so, for in those happy days I
always had a keen appetite. Bread and butter were
then infinitely superior to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâté de foie gras</i> now; but
still, thanks to my training, I had also a conscience. As
my mother had given me the food for dinner, I did not
think it right to convert it into lunch, even though I
was strongly tempted.</p>

<p>I think we had seventeen scholars&mdash;boys and girls&mdash;mostly
of my own age. Among them were some of my
after-companions. I have since met several of them&mdash;one
at Savannah and two at Mobile&mdash;respectably established,
and with families around them. Some remain,
and are now among the grey old men of the town: the
names of others I have seen inscribed on the tombstones
of their native village. And the rest&mdash;where are
they?</p>

<p>The school being assembled, we were all seated upon
benches, made of what were called <i>slabs</i>&mdash;that is, boards
having the exterior or rounded part of the log on one
side: as they were useless for other purposes, these were
converted into school-benches, the rounded part down.
They had each four supports, consisting of straddling
wooden legs set into augur-holes. Our own legs swayed
in the air, for they were too short to touch the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Oh, what an awe fell over me, when we were all seated
and silence reigned around!</p>

<p>The children were called up one by one to Aunt Delight,
who sat on a low chair, and required each, as a
preliminary, "to make his manners," which consisted of
a small, sudden nod. She then placed the spelling-book&mdash;which
was Dilworth's&mdash;before the pupil, and with a
buck-handled penknife pointed, one by one, to the letters
of the alphabet, saying, "What's that?" If the child
knew his letters, the "what's that?" very soon ran on
thus:&nbsp;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"A."</p>

<p>"'Stha-a-t?"</p>

<p>"B."</p>

<p>"Sna-a-a-t?"</p>

<p>"C."</p>

<p>"Sna-a-a-t?"</p>

<p>"D." &amp;c.</p>

<p>I looked upon these operations with intense curiosity
and no small respect, until my own turn came. I went
up to the schoolmistress with some emotion, and when
she said, rather spitefully, as I thought, "Make your
obeisance!" my little intellects all fled away, and I did
nothing. Having waited a second, gazing at me with
indignation, she laid her hand on the top of my head,
and gave it a jerk which made my teeth clash. I believe
I bit my tongue a little; at all events, my sense of dignity
was offended, and when she pointed to A, and asked
what it was, it swam before me dim and hazy, and as big
as a full moon. She repeated the question, but I was
doggedly silent. Again, a third time, she said, "What's
that?" I replied: "Why don't you tell me what it is?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
I didn't come here to learn you your letters." I have
not the slightest remembrance of this, for my brains were
all a wool-gathering; but as Aunt Delight affirmed it to
be a fact, and it passed into a tradition in my family, I
put it in.</p>

<p>What immediately followed I do not clearly remember,
but one result is distinctly traced in my memory.
In the evening of this eventful day the schoolmistress
paid my parents a visit, and recounted to their astonished
ears this my awful contempt of authority. My father,
after hearing the story, got up and went away; but
my mother, who was a careful disciplinarian, told me
not to do so again! I always had a suspicion that
both of them smiled on one side of their faces, even
while they seemed to sympathize with the old lady
on the other; still, I do not affirm it, for I am
bound to say of both my parents, that I never knew
them, even in trifles, say one thing while they meant
another.</p>

<p>I believe I achieved the alphabet that summer, but my
after progress, for a long time, I do not remember. Two
years later I went to the winter school at the same place,
kept by Lewis Olmstead&mdash;a man who made a business
of ploughing, mowing, carting manure, &amp;c., in the summer,
and of teaching school in the winter; with a talent
for music at all seasons, wherefore he became chorister
upon occasion, when, peradventure, Deacon Hawley
could not officiate. He was a celebrity in ciphering, and
Squire Seymour declared that he was the greatest "arithmeticker"
in Fairfield county. All I remember of his
person is his hand, which seemed to me as big as Goliath's,
judging by the claps of thunder it made in my ears
on one or two occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The next step of my progress which is marked in my
memory, is the spelling of words of two syllables. I did
not go very regularly to school, but by the time I was
ten years old I had learned to write, and had made a
little progress in arithmetic. There was not a grammar,
a geography, or a history of any kind in the school.
Reading, writing, and arithmetic were the only things
taught, and these very indifferently&mdash;not wholly from
the stupidity of the teacher, but because he had forty
scholars, and the custom of the age required no more
than he performed. I did as well as the other scholars,
certainly no better. I had excellent health and joyous
spirits; in leaping, running, and wrestling I had but one
superior of my age, and that was Stephen Olmstead, a
snug-built fellow, smaller than myself, and who, despite
our rivalry, was my chosen friend and companion. I
seemed to live for play: alas! how the world has
changed since then!</p>

<p>After I had left my native town for some twenty years,
I returned and paid it a visit. Among the monuments
that stood high in my memory was the West Lane
school-house. Unconsciously carrying with me the
measures of childhood, I had supposed it to be thirty feet
square; how had it dwindled when I came to estimate it
by the new standards I had formed! It was in all things
the same, yet wholly changed to me. What I had
deemed a respectable edifice, as it now stood before me
was only a weather-beaten little shed, which, upon being
measured, I found to be less than twenty feet square. It
happened to be a warm summer day, and I ventured to
enter the place. I found a girl, some eighteen years old,
keeping a ma'am school for about twenty scholars, some
of whom were studying Parley's Geography. The mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
was the daughter of one of my schoolmates, and
some of the boys and girls were grandchildren of the
little brood which gathered under the wing of Aunt Delight,
when I was an abecedarian. None of them, not
even the schoolmistress, had ever heard of me. The
name of my father, as having ministered to the people
of Ridgefield in some bygone age, was faintly traced in
their recollection. As to Peter Parley, whose geography
they were learning, they supposed him to be a decrepit
old gentleman hobbling about on a crutch, a long way
off, for whom, nevertheless, they had a certain affection,
inasmuch as he had made geography into a story-book.
The frontispiece picture of the old fellow, with his gouty
foot in a chair, threatening the boys that if they touched
his tender toe he would tell them no more stories,
secured their respect, and placed him among the
saints in the calendar of their young hearts. "Well,"
thought I, "if this goes on, I may yet rival Mother
Goose!"</p>

<p>I hope the reader will not imagine that I am thinking
too little of his amusement and too much of my own, if
I stop a few moments to note the lively recollections I
entertain of the joyousness of my early life, and not of
mine only, but that of my playmates and companions.
In looking back to those early days, the whole circle of
the seasons seems to me almost like one unbroken morning
of pleasure.</p>

<p>I was of course subjected to the usual crosses incident
to my age, those painful and mysterious visitations sent
upon children&mdash;the measles, mumps, whooping-cough,
and the like; usually regarded as retributions for the
false step of our mother Eve in the Garden; but they
have almost passed from my memory, as if overflowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and borne away by the general drift of happiness which
filled my bosom. Among these calamities, one monument
alone remains&mdash;the small-pox. It was in the year
1798, as I well remember, that my father's house was
converted into a hospital, or, as it was then called, a
"pest-house," where, with some dozen other children, I
was inoculated for this disease, then the scourge and
terror of the world.</p>

<p>The lane in which our house was situated was fenced
up, north and south, so as to cut off all intercourse with
the world around. A flag was raised, and upon it were
inscribed the ominous words, "<big>&#9758;</big> <span class="smcap">Small-pox</span>." My
uncle and aunt, from New Haven, arrived with their
three children. Half-a-dozen others of the neighborhood
were gathered together, making, with our own
children, somewhat over a dozen subjects for the experiment.
When all was ready, like Noah and his family,
we were shut in. Provisions were deposited in a basket
at a point agreed upon, down the lane. Thus we were
cut off from the world, excepting only that Dr. Perry,
the physician, ventured to visit us.</p>

<p>As to myself, the disease passed lightly over, leaving,
however, its indisputable autographs on various parts of
my body. Were it not for these testimonials, I should
almost suspect that I had escaped the disease, for I only
remember, among my symptoms and my sufferings, a
little headache, and the privation of salt and butter
upon my hasty-pudding. My restoration to these
privileges I distinctly recollect: doubtless these gave
me more pleasure than the clean bill of health
which they implied. Several of the patients suffered
severely, and among them my brother and one of my
cousins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>But although there is evidence that I was subject to
the usual drawbacks upon the happiness of childhood,
these were so few that they have passed from my mind;
and those early years, as I look back to them, seem to
have flowed on in one bright current of uninterrupted
enjoyment.</p>

<p>Let me now give you a sketch of Ridgefield and of
the people, how they lived, thought, and felt, at the beginning
of the present century. It will give you a good
idea of the rustic life of New England fifty years ago.</p>

<p>From what I have already said, you will easily imagine
the prominent physical characteristics and aspect of my
native town: a general mass of hills, rising up in a
crescent of low mountains, and commanding a wide view
on every side. The soil was naturally hard, and thickly
sown with stones of every size. The fields were divided
by rude stone walls, and the surface of most of them was
dotted with gathered heaps of stones and rocks, thus
clearing spaces for cultivation, yet leaving a large portion
of the land still encumbered. The climate was severe,
on account of the elevation of the site, yet this was perhaps
fully compensated by its salubrity.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the somewhat forbidding nature of the
soil and climate of Ridgefield, it may be regarded as
presenting a favorable example of New England country
life and society at the time I speak of. The town was
originally settled by a sturdy race of men, mostly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
immediate descendants of English emigrants, some from
Milford. Their migration over an intervening space of
savage hills, rocks and ravines, into a territory so uninviting,
and their speedy conversion of this into a thriving and
smiling village, bear witness to their courage and energy.</p>

<p>At the time referred to, the date of my earliest recollection,
the society of Ridgefield was exclusively English.
I remember but one Irishman, one negro, and one Indian in
the town. The first had begged and blarneyed his way
from Long Island, where he had been wrecked; the second
was a liberated slave; and the last was the vestige of
a tribe which dwelt of yore in a swampy tract, the name
of which I have forgotten. We had a professional beggar,
called Jagger, who had served in the armies of more
than one of the Georges, and insisted upon crying, "God
save the king!" even on the 4th of July, and when
openly threatened by the boys with a gratuitous ride on
a rail. We had one settled pauper, Mrs. Yabacomb,
who, for the first dozen years of my life, was my standard
type for the witch of Endor.</p>

<p>Nearly all the inhabitants of Ridgefield were farmers,
with the few mechanics that were necessary to carry on
society in a somewhat primeval state. Even the persons
not professionally devoted to agriculture had each his
farm, or at least his garden and home lot, with his pigs,
poultry, and cattle. The population might have been
1200, comprising two hundred families. All could read
and write, but in point of fact, beyond the Almanac and
Watts' Psalms and Hymns, their literary acquirements
had little scope. There were, I think, four newspapers,
all weekly, published in the State: one at Hartford, one
at New London, one at New Haven, and one at Litchfield.
There were, however, not more than three subscribers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to all these in our village. We had, however,
a public library of some two hundred volumes, and,
what was of equal consequence, the town was on the
road which was then the great thoroughfare, connecting
Boston with New York; and hence we had means of
intelligence from travellers constantly passing through
the place, which kept us acquainted with the march of
events.</p>

<p>If Ridgefield was thus rather above the average of
Connecticut villages in civilization, I suppose the circumstances
and modes of life in my father's family were
somewhat above those of most people around us. We
had a farm of forty acres, with four cows, two horses,
and some dozen sheep, to which may be added a stock
of poultry, including a flock of geese. My father carried
on the farm, besides preaching two sermons a-week, and
visiting the sick, attending funerals, solemnizing marriages,
&amp;c. He laid out the beds and planted the
garden; pruned the fruit-trees, and worked with the
men in the meadow in hay-time. He generally cut the
corn-stalks himself, and always shelled the ears; the latter
being done by drawing them across the handle of the
frying-pan, fastened over a wash-tub. I was sometimes
permitted, as an indulgence, to share this favorite employment
with my father. With these and a few other
exceptions, our agricultural operations were carried on
by hired help.</p>

<p>It was the custom in New England, at the time I
speak of, for country lawyers, physicians, clergymen,
even doctors of divinity, to partake of these homespun
labors. In the library of the Athenæum, at Hartford, is
a collection of almanacs, formerly belonging to John
Cotton Smith&mdash;one of the most elegant and accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
men of his time&mdash;a distinguished Member of Congress,
Judge of the Superior Court, and several years Governor
of the State; in looking it over, I observed such notes
as the following, made with his own hand: "Cut my
barley," "began rye harvest," "planted field of potatoes,"
&amp;c.: thus showing his personal attention to, if not his
participation in, the affairs of the farm. Nearly all the
judges of the Superior Court occasionally worked in the
field, in these hearty old federal times.</p>

<p>But I returned to Ridgefield. The household, as well
as political, economy of those days lay in this,&mdash;that
every family lived as much as possible within itself.
Money was scarce, wages being about fifty cents a-day,
though these were generally paid in meat, vegetables,
and other articles of use&mdash;seldom in money. There was
not a factory of any kind in the place.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> There was a
butcher, but he only went from house to house to
slaughter the cattle and swine of his neighbors. There
was a tanner, but he only dressed other people's skins.
There was a clothier, but he generally fulled and dressed
other people's cloth. All this is typical of the mechanical
operations of the place. Even dyeing blue a portion
of the wool, so as to make linsey-woolsey for short
gowns, aprons, and blue-mixed stockings&mdash;vital necessities
in those days&mdash;was a domestic operation. During
the autumn, a dye-tub in the chimney corner&mdash;thus
placed so as to be cherished by the genial heat&mdash;was as
familiar in all thrifty houses as the Bible or the back-log.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
It was covered with a board, and formed a cosy seat in
the wide-mouthed fireplace, especially of a chill evening.
When the night had waned, and the family had retired,
it frequently became the anxious seat of the lover, who
was permitted to carry on his courtship, the object of his
addresses sitting demurely in the opposite corner. Some
of the first families in Connecticut, I suspect, could their
full annals be written, would find their foundations to
have been laid in these chimney-corner courtships.</p>

<p>Being thus exposed, the dye-tub was the frequent subject
of distressing and exciting accidents. Among the
early, indelible incidents in my memory, one of the most
prominent is turning this over. Nothing so roused the
indignation of thrifty housewives, for, besides the stain
left upon the floor by the blue, a most disagreeable odor
was diffused by it.</p>

<p>To this general system of domestic economy our family
was not an exception. Every autumn, it was a matter of
course that we had a fat ox or a fat cow ready for
slaughter. One full barrel was salted down; the hams
were cut out, slightly salted, and hung up in the chimney
for a few days, and thus became "dried" or "hung beef,"
then as essential as bread. Pork was managed in a
similar way, though even on a larger scale, for two barrels
were indispensable. A few pieces, as the spare-ribs,
&amp;c., were distributed to the neighbors, who paid in kind
when they killed their swine.</p>

<p>Mutton and poultry came in their turn, all from our
own stock, except when on Thanksgiving-day some of
the magnates gave the parson a turkey. This, let me
observe, in those good old times, was a bird of mark; no
timid, crouching biped, with downcast head and pallid
countenance, but stalking like a lord, and having wattles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
red as a "banner bathed in slaughter." His beard was
long, shining, and wiry. There was, in fact, something
of the native bird still in him, for though the race was
nearly extinct, a few wild flocks lingered in the remote
woods. Occasionally, in the depth of winter, and
towards the early spring, these stole to the barnyard, and
held communion with their civilized cousins. Severe
battles ensued among the leaders for the favors of the
fair, and as the wild cocks always conquered, the vigor
of the race was kept up.</p>

<p>Our bread was made of rye, mixed with Indian meal.
Wheat bread was reserved for the sacrament and company;
a proof not of its superiority, but of its scarcity
and consequent estimation. All the vegetables came
from our garden and farm. The fuel was supplied by our
own woods&mdash;sweet-scented hickory, snapping chestnut,
odoriferous oak, and reeking, fizzling ash&mdash;the hot juice
of the latter, by the way, being a sovereign antidote for
the earache. These were laid in huge piles, all alive with
sap, on the tall, gaunt andirons. The building of a fire,
a real architectural achievement, was always begun by
daybreak. There was first a back-log, from fifteen to
four-and-twenty inches in diameter, and five feet long,
imbedded in the ashes; then came a top log, then a fore
stick, then a middle stick, and then a heap of kindlings,
reaching from the bowels down to the bottom. Above
all was a pyramid of smaller fragments, artfully adjusted,
with spaces for the blaze. Friction matches had not then
been invented. So, if there were no coals left from the
last night's fire, and none to be borrowed from the neighbors,
resort was had to flint, steel, and tinder-box. Often,
when the flint was dull, and the steel soft, and the tinder
damp, the striking of fire was a task requiring both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
energy and patience. If the pile on the andirons was
skilfully constructed, the spark being applied, there was
soon a furious stinging smoke; but the forked flame soon
began to lick the sweating sticks above, and by the time
the family had arisen, and assembled in the "keeping-room,"
there was a roaring blaze, defying the bitter blasts
of winter, which found abundant admittance through the
crannies of the doors and windows. To feed the family
fire in those days, during the severe season, was fully one
man's work.</p>

<p>But to go on with our household history. Sugar was
partially supplied by our maple-trees. These were tapped
in March, the sap being collected, and boiled down
in the woods. This was wholly a domestic operation,
and one in which all the children rejoiced, each taking
his privilege of tasting, at every stage of the manufacture.
The chief supply of sugar, however, was from the West
Indies.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MAKING MAPLE-SUGAR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Rum was largely consumed, but our distilleries had
scarcely begun. A half-pint of it was given as a matter
of course to every day laborer, more particularly in the
summer season. In all families, rich or poor, it was
offered to male visitors as an essential point of hospitality,
or even good manners. Women&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;ladies,
took their schnapps, then named "Hopkins' Elixir,"
which was the most delicious and seductive means of getting
tipsy that has been invented. Crying babies were
silenced with hot toddy. Every man imbibed his morning
dram, and this was esteemed temperance. There is
a story of a preacher, about those days, who thus lectured
his parish: "I say nothing, my beloved brethren, against
taking a little bitters before breakfast, and after breakfast;
especially if you are used to it. What I contend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
against is, this dramming, dramming, dramming, at all
hours of the day. There are some men who take a glass
at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and at four in the afternoon.
I do not purpose to contend against old-established
customs, my brethren, rendered respectable by time
and authority; but this dramming, dramming, is a crying
sin in the land."</p>

<p>As to brandy, I scarcely heard of it, so far as I can
recollect, till I was sixteen years old, and, as an apprentice
in a country store, was called upon to sell it. Cider
was the universal table beverage. Brandy and whisky
soon after came into use. I remember, in my boyhood,
to have seen a strange zigzag tin tube, denominated a
"still," belonging to one of our neighbors, converting,
drop by drop, certain innocent liquids into "fire-water."
But, in the days I speak of, French brandy was confined
to the houses of the rich, and to the drug-shop.</p>

<p>Wine, in our country towns, was then almost exclusively
used for the sacrament.</p>

<p>There was, of course, no baker in Ridgefield; each
family not only made its own bread, cakes, and pies, but
its own soap, candles, butter, cheese, and the like. The
manufacture of linen and woollen cloth was no less a
domestic operation. Cotton&mdash;that is, raw cotton&mdash;was
then wholly unknown among us at the North, except as
a mere curiosity, produced somewhere in the tropics; but
whether it grew on a plant, or an animal, was not clearly
settled in the public mind.</p>

<p>We raised our own flax, rotted it, hackled it, dressed
it, and spun it. The little wheel, turned by the foot, had
its place, and was as familiar as if it had been a member
of the family. How often have I seen my mother, and
my grandmother, too, sit down to it&mdash;though this, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
remember, was for the purpose of spinning some finer
kind of thread&mdash;the burden of the spinning being done
by a neighbor of ours, Sally St. John. By the way, she
was a good-hearted, cheerful old maid, who petted me
beyond my deserts. I grieve to say, that I repaid her
partiality by many mischievous pranks; for which I
should have been roundly punished, had not the good
creature forgiven and concealed my offences. I did,
indeed, get fillipped for catching her foot one day in a
steel-trap; but I declare that I was innocent of malice
prepense, inasmuch as I had set the trap for a rat, instead
of the said Sally. Nevertheless, the verdict was against
me; not wholly on account of my misdemeanor in this
particular instance, but because, if I did not deserve
punishment for that, I had deserved it, and should deserve
it for something else; and so it was safe to administer it.</p>

<p>The wool was also spun in the family; partly by my
sisters, and partly by Molly Gregory, daughter of our
neighbor, the town carpenter. I remember her well as
she sang and spun aloft in the attic. In those days,
church-singing was the only one of the fine arts which
flourished in Ridgefield, except the music of the drum and
fife. The choir was divided into four parts, ranged on
three sides of the meeting-house gallery. The tenor, led
by Deacon Hawley, was in front of the pulpit, the bass
to the left, and the treble and counter to the right; the
whole being set in motion by a pitch-pipe, made by the
deacon himself, who was a cabinet-maker. Molly took
upon herself the entire counter, for she had excellent
lungs. The fuguing tunes, which had then run a little
mad, were her delight. In her solitary operations aloft
I have often heard her send forth, from the attic windows,
the droning hum of her wheel, with fitful snatches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of a hymn, in which the bass began, the tenor followed,
then the treble, and, finally, the counter&mdash;winding up
with irresistible pathos. Molly singing to herself, and
all unconscious of eavesdroppers, carried on all the parts
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Bass.</i>     "Long for a cooling&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tenor.</i>    "Long for a cooling&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Treble.</i>   "Long for a cooling&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Counter.</i>  "Long for a cooling stream at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">And they must drink or die!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The knitting of stockings was performed by the women
of the family in the evening, and especially at tea-parties.
This was considered a moral, as well as an economical,
employment; for people held, with Dr. Watts, that</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Satan finds some mischief still<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For idle hands to do."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Satan, however, dodged the question: for if the hands
were occupied the tongue was loose; and it was said
that, in some families, he kept them well occupied with
idle gossip. At all events, pianos, chess-boards, graces,
battledoors and shuttlecocks, with other safety-valves of
the kind, were only known by the hearing of the ear, as
belonging to some such Vanity Fair as New York or
Boston.</p>

<p>The weaving of cloth&mdash;linen as well as woollen&mdash;was
performed by an itinerant workman, who came to the
house, put up his loom, and threw his shuttle, till the
season's work was done. The linen was bleached and
made up by the family; the woollen cloth was sent to
the fuller to be dyed and dressed. Twice a-year, that is,
in the spring and autumn, the tailor came to the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and made a stock of clothes for the male members; this
was called "whipping the cat."</p>

<p>Mantuamakers and milliners came, in their turn, to fit
out the female members of the family. There was a
similar process as to boots and shoes. We sent the hides
of the cattle&mdash;cows and calves we had killed&mdash;to the
tanner, and these came back in assorted leather. Occasionally
a little morocco, then wholly a foreign manufacture,
was bought at the store, and made up for the ladies'
best shoes. Amby Benedict, the travelling shoemaker,
came with his bench, lapstone, and awls, and converted
some little room into a shop, till the household was duly
shod. He was a merry fellow, and threw in lots of singing
gratis. He played all the popular airs upon his lapstone&mdash;as
hurdygurdies and hand-organs do now.</p>

<p>Carpets were then only known in a few families, and
were confined to the keeping-room and parlor. They
were all home-made: the warp consisting of woollen
yarn, and the woof of lists and old woollen cloth, cut
into strips, and sewed together at the ends. Coverlids
generally consisted of quilts, made of pieces of waste
calico, sewed together in octagons, and quilted in rectangles,
giving the whole a gay and rich appearance.
This process of quilting generally brought together the
women of the neighborhood, married and single; and a
great time they had of it, what with tea, talk, and stitching.
In the evening the men were admitted; so that a
quilting was a real festival, not unfrequently leading to
love-making and marriage among the young people.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a sort of communism or socialism,
which prevailed in our rural districts long before Owen
or Fourier was born. At Ridgefield we used to have
"stone bees," when all the men of a village or hamlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
came together with their draught cattle, and united to
clear some patch of earth of stones and rocks. All this
labor was gratuitously rendered, save only that the proprietor
of the land furnished the grog. Such a meeting
was always, of course, a very social and sociable affair.</p>

<p>When the work was done, gymnastic exercises&mdash;such
as hopping, wrestling, and foot-racing&mdash;took place among
the athletic young men. My father generally attended
these celebrations as a looker-on. It was, indeed, the
custom for the clergy of the olden time to mingle with
the people, even in their labors and their pastimes. For
some reason or other, it seemed that things went better
when the parson gave them his countenance. I followed
my father's example, and attended these cheerful and
beneficial gatherings. Most of the boys of the town did
the same. I may add that, if I may trust the traditions
of Ridgefield, the cellar of our new house was dug by a
"bee" in a single day, and that was Christmas.</p>

<p>House-raising and barn-raising, the framework being
always of wood, were done in the same way by a neighborly
gathering of the people. I remember an anecdote
of a church-raising, which I may as well relate here. In
the eastern part of the State, I think at Lyme, or Pautipaug,
a meeting-house was destroyed by lightning. After
a year or two the society mustered its energies, and raised
the frame of another on the site of the old one. It
stood about six months, and was then blown over. In
due time another frame was prepared, and the neighborhood
gathered together to raise it. It was now proposed
by Deacon Hart that they should commence the performances
by a prayer and hymn, it having been suggested
that perhaps the want of these pious preliminaries
on former occasions had something to do with the calamitous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
results which attended them. When all was
ready, therefore, a prayer was made, and the chorister
of the place gave out two lines of the hymn, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If God to build the house deny,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The builders work in vain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This being sung, the chorister completed the verse
thus, adapting the lines to the occasion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Unless the Lord doth shingle it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It will blow down agin!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I must not fail to give you a portrait of one of our
village homes, of the middle class, at this era. I take as
an example that of our neighbor, J. B., who had been
a tailor, but having thriven in his affairs, and being now
some fifty years old, had become a farmer. It was
situated on the road leading to Salem, there being a wide
space in front occupied by the wood-pile, which in these
days was not only a matter of great importance, but of
formidable bulk. The size of the wood-pile was, indeed,
in some sort an index to the rank and condition of the
proprietor. The house itself was a low edifice, forty feet
long, and of two stories in front; the rear being what
was called a <i>breakback</i>&mdash;that is, sloping down to a height
of ten feet; this low part furnishing a shelter for garden
tools and various household instruments. The whole
was constructed of wood, the outside being of the dun
complexion assumed by unpainted wood, exposed to the
weather for twenty or thirty years, save only that the
roof was tinged of a reddish brown by a fine moss that
found sustenance in the chestnut shingles.</p>

<p>To the left was the garden, which in the productive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
season was a wilderness of onions, squashes, cucumbers,
beets, parsnips, and currants, with the never-failing tansy
for bitters, horseradish for seasoning, and fennel for keeping
old women awake in church time.</p>

<p>The interior of the house presented a parlor with plain,
whitewashed walls, a home-made carpet upon the floor,
calico curtains at the window, and a mirror three feet by
two against the side, with a mahogany frame: to these
must be added eight chairs and a cherry table, of the
manufacture of Deacon Hawley. The "keeping" or
sitting-room had also a carpet, a dozen rush-bottom chairs,
a table, &amp;c. The kitchen was large&mdash;fully twenty feet
square, with a fireplace six feet wide and four feet deep.
On one side it looked out upon the garden, the squashes
and cucumbers climbing up and forming festoons over
the door; on the other it commanded a view of the
orchard, embracing first a circle of peaches, pears, and
plums; and beyond, a wide-spread clover-field, embowered
with apple-trees. Just by was the well, with its tall
sweep, the old oaken bucket dangling from the pole.
The kitchen was, in fact, the most comfortable room
in the house; cool in summer, and perfumed with the
breath of the garden and the orchard: in winter, with
its roaring blaze of hickory, it was a cosy resort, defying
the bitterest blasts of the season. Here the whole family
assembled at meals, except when the presence of company
made it proper to serve tea in the parlor.</p>

<p>The bed-rooms were all without carpets, and the furniture
was generally of a simple character. The beds, however,
were of ample size, and well filled with geese
feathers, these being deemed essential for comfortable
people. I must say, by the way, that every decent
family had its flock of geese, of course, which was picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
thrice a-year, despite the noisy remonstrances of both
goose and gander. The sheets of the bed, though of
home-made linen, were as white as the driven snow.
Indeed, the beds of this era showed that sleep was a
luxury, well understood and duly cherished by all classes.
The cellar, extending under the whole house, was by no
means the least important part of the establishment. In
the autumn, it was supplied with three barrels of beef
and as many of pork, twenty barrels of cider, with
numerous bins of potatoes, turnips, beets, carrots, and
cabbages. The garret, which was of huge dimensions,
at the same time displayed a labyrinth of dried pumpkins,
peaches, and apples, hung in festoons upon the rafters,
amid bunches of summer savory, boneset, fennel, and
other herbs, the floor being occupied by heaps of wool,
flax, tow, and the like.</p>

<p>The barn corresponded to the house. It was a low
brown structure, having abundance of sheds built on to
it, without the least regard to symmetry. It was well
stocked with hay, oats, rye, and buckwheat. Six cows,
one or two horses, three dozen sheep, and an ample
supply of poultry, including two or three broods of
turkeys, constituted its living tenants.</p>

<p>The farm I need not describe in detail, but the orchard
must not be overlooked. This consisted of three acres,
covered, as I have said, with apple-trees, yielding abundantly&mdash;as
well for the cider-mill as for the table, including
the indispensable winter apple-sauce&mdash;according to
their kinds. I think an apple orchard in the spring is
one of the most beautiful objects in the world. How
often have I ventured into Uncle Josey's ample orchard
at this joyous season, and stood entranced among the
robins, blackbirds, woodpeckers, bluebirds, jays, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
orioles,&mdash;all seeming to me like playmates, racing, chasing,
singing, rollicking, in the exuberance of their joy,
or perchance slily pursuing their courtships, or even more
slily building their nests and rearing their young.</p>

<p>The inmates of the house I need not describe, further
than to say that Uncle Josey himself was a little deaf,
and of moderate abilities; yet he lived to good account,
for he reared a large family, and was gathered to his
fathers at a good old age, leaving behind him a handsome
estate, a fair name, and a good example. His wife,
who spent her early life at service in a kitchen, was a
handsome, lively, efficient woman, and a universal
favorite in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>This is the homely picture of a Ridgefield farmer's
home half a century ago. There were other establishments
more extensive and more sumptuous in the town,
as there were others also of an inferior grade; but this
was a fair sample of the houses, barns, and farms of the
middle class.</p>

<p>You will now have some ideas of the household industry
and occupations of the country people in Connecticut, at
the beginning of the present century. Their manners,
in other respects, had a corresponding stamp of homeliness
and simplicity.</p>

<p>In most families, the first exercise of the morning was
reading the Bible, followed by a prayer, at which all
were assembled, including the servants and helpers of the
kitchen and the farm. Then came the breakfast, which
was a substantial meal, always including hot viands, with
vegetables, apple-sauce, pickles, mustard, horseradish, and
various other condiments. Cider was the common drink
for laboring people: even children drank it at will. Tea
was common, but not so general as now. Coffee was
almost unknown. Dinner was a still more hearty and
varied repast&mdash;characterised by abundance of garden
vegetables; tea was a light supper.</p>

<p>The day began early: the breakfast hour was six in
summer and seven in winter; dinner was at noon&mdash;the
work-people in the fields being called to their meals by
a conchshell winded by some kitchen Triton. Tea was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
usually taken about sundown. In families where all
were laborers, all sat at table, servants as well as masters&mdash;the
food being served before sitting down. In families
where the masters and mistresses did not share the labors
of the household or the farm, the meals of the domestics
were taken separately. There was, however, in those
days a perfectly good understanding and good feeling
between the masters and servants. The latter were not
Irish: they had not as yet imbibed the plebeian envy of
those above them, which has since so generally embittered
and embarrassed American domestic life. The
terms "democrat" and "aristocrat" had not got into
use: these distinctions, and the feelings now implied by
them, had indeed no existence in the hearts of the people.
Our servants, during all my early life, were
generally the daughters of respectable farmers and
mechanics in the neighborhood, and, respecting others,
were themselves respected and cherished. They were
devoted to the interests of the family, and were always
relied upon and treated as friends. In health they had
the same food, in sickness the same care, as the masters
and mistresses or their children.</p>

<p>At the period of my earliest recollections, men of all
classes were dressed in long, broad-tailed coats, with
huge pockets; long waistcoats, breeches, and hats with
low crowns and broad brims: some so wide as to be
supported at the sides with cords. The stockings of the
parson, and a few others, were of silk in summer and
worsted in winter; those of the people were generally
of wool. Women dressed in wide bonnets, sometimes
of straw and sometimes of silk; and gowns of silk,
muslin, gingham, &amp;c., generally close and short-waisted,
the breast and shoulders being covered by a full muslin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
kerchief. Girls ornamented themselves with a large white
vandike. On the whole, the dress of both men and
women has greatly changed; for at Ridgefield, as at less
remote places, the people follow, though at a distance,
the fashions of Paris.</p>

<p>The amusements were then much the same as at present,
though some striking differences may be noted.
Books and newspapers were then scarce, and were read
respectfully, and as if they were grave matters, demanding
thought and attention. They were not toys and
pastimes, taken up every day, and by everybody, in the
short intervals of labor, and then hastily dismissed, like
waste paper. The aged sat down when they read, and
drew forth their spectacles, and put them deliberately
and reverently upon the nose. Even the young approached
a book with reverence, and a newspaper with
awe. How the world has changed!</p>

<p>The two great festivals were Thanksgiving and "Training-day;"
the latter deriving, from the still lingering
spirit of the revolutionary war, a decidedly martial character.
The marching of the troops, and the discharge
of gunpowder, which invariably closed the exercises, were
glorious and inspiring mementoes of heroic achievements
upon many a bloody field. The music of the drum and
fife resounded on every side. A match between two
rival drummers always drew an admiring crowd, and
was in fact one of the chief excitements of the great day.</p>

<p>Tavern-haunting, especially in winter, when there was
little to do, for manufactures had not then sprung up to
give profitable occupation during this inclement season,
was common even with respectable farmers. Marriages
were celebrated in the evening, at the house of the
bride, with a general gathering of the neighborhood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
were usually finished off by dancing. Everybody went,
as to a public exhibition, without invitation. Funerals
generally drew large processions, which proceeded to the
grave. Here the minister always made an address suited
to the occasion. If there were anything remarkable in
the history of the deceased, it was turned to religious account
in the next Sunday's sermon. Singing-meetings,
to practise church music, were a great resource for the
young in winter. Dances at private houses were common,
and drew no reproaches from the sober people present.
Balls at the taverns were frequented by the young;
the children of deacons and ministers attended, though
the parents did not. The winter brought sleighing,
skating, and the usual round of indoor sports. In general,
the intercourse of all classes was kindly and considerate,
no one arrogating superiority, and yet no one
refusing to acknowledge it where it existed. You would
hardly have noticed that there was a higher and a lower
class. Such there were, certainly; for there must always
and everywhere be the strong and the weak, the
wise and the foolish. But in our society these existed
without being felt as a privilege to one, which must give
offence to another.</p>

<p>It may serve in some degree to throw light upon
the manners and customs of this period, if I give you a
sketch of my two grandmothers. Both were widows,
and were well stricken in years when they came to visit
us at Ridgefield, about the year 1803-4. My grandmother
Ely was a lady of the old school, and sustaining
the character in her upright carriage, her long, tapering
waist, and her high-heeled shoes. The customs of Louis
XV.'s time had prevailed in New York and Boston, and
even at this period they still lingered there in isolated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
cases. It is curious enough, that at this time the female
attire of a century ago is revived; and every black-eyed,
stately old lady, dressed in black silk, and showing her
steel-grey hair beneath her cap, reminds me of my maternal
grandmother.</p>

<p>My other grandmother was in all things the opposite;
short, fat, blue-eyed, and practical; a good example of a
hearty country dame. I scarcely knew which of the two
I liked the best. The first sang me plaintive songs, told
me stories of the Revolution&mdash;her husband, Col. Ely,
having had a large and painful share in its vicissitudes&mdash;she
described Gen. Washington, whom she had seen;
and the French officers, Lafayette, Rochambeau, and
others, who had been inmates of her house. She told
me tales of even more ancient date, and recited poetry,
generally ballads, which were suited to my taste. And
all this lore was commended to me by a voice of inimitable
tenderness, and a manner at once lofty and condescending.
My other grandmother was not less kind, but
she promoted my happiness and prosperity in another
way. Instead of stories, she gave me bread and butter:
in place of poetry, she fed me with apple-sauce and pie.
Never was there a more hearty old lady: she had a firm
conviction that children must be fed, and what she believed
she practised.</p>

<p>I can recollect with great vividness the interest I took
in the domestic events I have described. The operations
of the farm had no great attractions for me. Ploughing,
hoeing, digging, seemed to me mere drudgery, imparting
no instruction, and affording no scope for ingenuity or
invention.</p>

<p>Mechanical operations, especially those of the weaver
and carpenter, on the contrary, stimulated my curiosity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and excited my emulation. Thus I soon became familiar
with the carpenter's tools, and made such windmills,
kites, and perpetual motions, as to win the admiration of
my playmates, and excite the respect of my parents; so
that they seriously meditated putting me apprentice to a
carpenter. Up to the age of fourteen, I think this was
regarded as my manifest destiny. It was a day of great
endeavors among all inventive geniuses. Fulton was
struggling to develop steam navigation; and other discoverers
were seeking to unfold the wonders of art as
well as of nature. It was, in fact, the very threshold of
the era of steam-boats, railroads, electric telegraphs, and a
thousand other useful discoveries, which have since changed
the face of the world. In this age of excitement, perpetual
motion was the great hobby of aspiring mechanics.
I pondered and whittled intensely on this subject before
I was ten years old. Despairing of reaching my object
by mechanical means, I attempted to arrive at it by
magnetism, my father having bought me a pair of horse-shoe
magnets in one of his journeys to New Haven. I
should have succeeded, had it not been a principle in the
nature of this curious element, that no substance will intercept
the stream of attraction. I tried to change the
poles, and turn the north against the south; but there,
too, nature had headed me, and of course I failed.</p>

<p>A word, by the way, on the matter of whittling. This
is generally represented as a sort of idle, fidgety, frivolous
use of the penknife, and is set down, by foreigners
and sketchers of American manners, as a peculiar characteristic
of our people. No portrait of an American is
deemed complete, unless with penknife and shingle in
hand. I feel not the slightest disposition to resent even
this, among the thousand caricatures that pass for traits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of American life. For my own part, I can testify that,
during my youthful days, I found the penknife a source
of great amusement, and even of instruction. Many a
long winter evening, many a dull, drizzly day, in spring,
and summer, and autumn&mdash;sometimes at the kitchen fireside,
sometimes in the attic, sometimes in a cosy nook of
the barn, sometimes in the shelter of a neighboring stone
wall, thatched over with wild grape-vines&mdash;have I spent
in great ecstasy, making candle-rods, or some other simple
article of household goods, for my mother; or in
perfecting toys for myself and my young friends; or perhaps
in attempts at more ambitious achievements. This
was not mere waste of time; mere idleness and dissipation.
I was amused: that was something. Some of the
pleasantest remembrances of my childhood carry me back
to the scenes I have just indicated; when, in happy solitude,
absorbed in my mechanical devices, I listened to
the rain pattering upon the roof, or the wind roaring
down the chimney: thus enjoying a double bliss, a pleasing
occupation, with a conscious delight in my sense of
security from the rage of the elements without.</p>

<p>Nay more; these occupations were instructive: my
mind was stimulated to inquire into the mechanical powers,
and my hand was educated to mechanical dexterity.
If you ask me why it is that this important institution of
whittling is indigenous among us, I reply that, in the
first place, our country is full of a great variety of woods,
suited to carpentry, many of them easily wrought, and
thus inviting boyhood to try its hands upon them. In
the next place, labor is dear; and therefore even children
are led to supply themselves with toys, or perchance to
furnish some of the simpler articles of use to the household.
This dearness of labor, moreover, furnishes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
powerful stimulant to the production of labor-saving
machines; and hence it is&mdash;through all these causes co-operating
one with another&mdash;that steam-navigation, the
electric telegraph, the steam-reaper, &amp;c., &amp;c., are American
inventions: hence it is that, whether it be at the World's
Fair at London or Paris, we gain a greater proportion of
prizes for useful inventions than any other people. That
is what comes of whittling!</p>

<p>I must add, that in these early days I was a Nimrod,
a mighty hunter; first with a bow and arrow, and afterwards
with the old hereditary firelock, which snapped six
times and went off once. The smaller kinds of game
were abundant. The thickets teemed with quails;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> partridges
drummed in every wood; the gray squirrel&mdash;the
most picturesque animal of our forests&mdash;enlivened every
hickory copse with his mocking laugh, his lively gambols,
and his long, bushy tail. The pigeons, in spring
and autumn, migrated in countless flocks; and many lingered
in our woods for the season.</p>

<p>Everybody was then a hunter; not, of course, a sportsman:
for the chase was followed more for profit than for
pastime. Game was, in point of fact, a substantial portion
of the supply of food at certain seasons of the year.
All were then good shots, and my father was no exception:
he was even beyond his generation in netting
pigeons. This was not deemed a reproach at that time
in a clergyman; nor was he the only parson that indulged
in these occupations. One day, as I was with
him on West Mountain, baiting pigeons, we had seduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a flock of three or four dozen down into the bed where
they were feeding; my father and myself lying concealed
in our bush-hut, close by. Suddenly, whang went a gun
into the middle of the flock! Out we ran in great indignation;
for at least a dozen of the birds were bleeding
and fluttering before us. Scarcely had we reached the
spot, when we met Parson M&mdash;&mdash;, of Lower Salem, who
had thus unwittingly poached upon us. The two clergymen
had first a squabble, and then a good laugh; after
which they divided the plunder and then parted.</p>

<p>The stories told by Wilson and Audubon as to the
amazing quantity of pigeons in the West, were realized
by us in Connecticut half-a-century ago. I have seen, in
the county of Fairfield, a stream of these noble birds
pouring at brief intervals through the skies, from the
rising to the setting sun. Of all the pigeon tribe, this
of our country&mdash;the passenger pigeon&mdash;is the swiftest
and most beautiful. At the same time, it is unquestionably
superior to any other for the table. All the other
species of the eastern, as well as the western continent,
which I have tasted, are soft and flavorless in comparison.</p>

<p>I can recollect no sports of my youth which equalled
in excitement our pigeon hunts, which generally took
place in September and October. We usually started on
horseback before daylight, and made a rapid progress to
some stubble-field on West Mountain. The ride in the
keen, fresh air, especially as the dawn began to break,
was delightful. The gradual encroachment of day upon
the night filled my mind with sublime images: the
waking up of a world from sleep, the joyousness of birds
and beasts in the return of morning, and my own sympathy
in this cheerful and grateful homage of the heart
to God, the Giver of good&mdash;all contributed to render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
these adventures most impressive upon my young heart.
My memory is still full of the sights and sounds of those
glorious mornings: the silvery whistle of the wings of
migrating flocks of plover, invisible in the gray mists of
dawn; the faint murmur of the distant mountain torrents;
the sonorous gong of the long-trailing flocks of
wild geese, seeming to come from the unseen depths of
the skies&mdash;these were among the suggestive sounds that
stole through the dim twilight. As morning advanced,
the scene was inconceivably beautiful: the mountain
sides, clothed in autumnal green, and purple, and gold,
rendered more glowing by the sunrise&mdash;with the valleys
covered with mists, and spreading out like lakes of silver;
while on every side the ear was saluted by the
mocking screams of the red-headed woodpecker, the
cawing of congresses of crows; and, finally, the rushing
sound of the pigeons, pouring like a tide over the tops
of the trees.</p>

<p>By this time of course our nets were ready, and our
flyers and stool-birds on the alert. What moments of
ecstasy were these, and especially when the head of the
flock&mdash;some red-breasted old father or grandfather&mdash;caught
the sight of our pigeons, and turning at the call,
drew the whole train down into our net-bed! I have
often seen a hundred, or two hundred of these splendid
birds, come upon us, with a noise absolutely deafening.
Sometimes our bush-hut, where we lay concealed, was
covered all over with pigeons, and we dared not move a
finger, as their red, piercing eyes were upon us. When
at last, with a sudden pull of the rope, the net was
sprung, and we went out to secure our booty&mdash;often fifty,
and sometimes even a hundred birds&mdash;I felt a fulness of
triumph which words are wholly inadequate to express!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to the age of eight years I was never trusted with
a gun. Whenever I went forth as a sportsman on my own
account, it was only with a bow and arrow. My performances
as a hunter were very moderate. In truth, I
had a rickety old gun, that had belonged to my grandfather,
and though it perhaps had done good service in
the Revolution, or further back in the times of bears and
wolves, it was now very decrepit, and all around the lock
seemed to have the shaking palsy. Occasionally I met
with adventures, half serious and half ludicrous. Once,
in running my hand into a hole in a hollow tree, some
twenty feet from the ground, being in search of a woodpecker,
I hauled out a blacksnake. At another time, in
a similar way, I had my fingers pretty sharply nipped by
a screech-owl. My memory supplies me with numerous
instances of this kind.</p>

<p>As to fishing, I never had a passion for it: I was too
impatient. I had no enthusiasm for nibbles, and there
were too many of these in proportion to the bites. I
perhaps resembled a man by the name of Bennett, who
joined the Shakers of New Canaan about these days, but
soon left them, declaring that the Spirit was too long in
coming&mdash;"he could not wait." Nevertheless, I dreamed
away some pleasant hours in angling in the brooks and
ponds of my native town. I well remember, that on my
eighth birthday I went four miles to Burt's mills, carrying
on the old mare two bushels of rye. While my grist
was being ground I angled in the pond, and carried
home enough for a generous meal.</p>

<p>Now all these things may seem trifles, yet in a review
of my life I deem them of some significance. This
homely familiarity with the more mechanical arts was a
material part of my education: this communion with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
nature gave me instructive and important lessons from
nature's open book of knowledge. My technical education,
as will be seen hereafter, was extremely narrow and
irregular. This defect was at least partially supplied by
the commonplace incidents I have mentioned. The
teachings, or rather the training of the senses, in the
country&mdash;ear and eye, foot and hand, by running, leaping,
climbing over hill and mountain, by occasional labor
in the garden and on the farm, and by the use of tools,
and all this in youth&mdash;is sowing seed which is repaid
largely and readily to the hand of after-cultivation, however
unskilful it may be. This is not so much because
of the amount of knowledge available in after-life, which
is thus obtained&mdash;though this is not to be despised&mdash;as
it is that healthful, vigorous, manly habits and associations,
physical, moral, and intellectual, are thus established
and developed.</p>

POLITENESS QUITE NATURAL&mdash;LOCOMOTION&mdash;PUBLIC CONVEYANCES&mdash;MY
FATHER'S CHAISE.</p></blockquote>


<p>The incidents I have just related occurred about the
year 1800&mdash;some a little earlier and some a little later.
Among the events of general interest that happened near
this time I remember the death of Washington, which
took place in 1799, and was commemorated all through
the country by the tolling of bells, funeral ceremonies,
orations, sermons, hymns, and dirges, attended by a
mournful sense of his loss, which seemed to cast a pall
over the entire heavens. In Ridgefield the meeting-house
was dressed in black, and we had a discourse pronounced
by a Mr. Edmonds, of Newtown. The subject,
indeed, engrossed all minds. Lieutenant Smith came
every day to our house to talk over the event, and to
bring us the proceedings in different parts of the country.
Among other papers he brought us a copy of the
<cite>Connecticut Courant</cite>, which gave us the particulars of
the rites and ceremonies which took place in Hartford in
commemoration of the great man's decease. The celebrated
hymn, written for the occasion by Theodore
Dwight, sank into my mother's heart&mdash;for she had a
constitutional love of things mournful and poetical&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
she often repeated it, so that it became a part of the
cherished lore of my childhood.</p>

<p>I give you these scenes and feelings in some detail, to
impress you with the depth and sincerity of this mourning
of the American nation, in cities and towns, in villages
and hamlets, for the death of Washington.</p>

<p>I have already said that Ridgefield was on the great
thoroughfare between Boston and New York, for the day
of steamers and railroads had not dawned. Even the
mania for turnpikes, which ere long overspread New
England, had not yet arrived. The stage-coaches took
four days to make the trip of two hundred miles between
the two great cities. In winter, during the furious
snow-storms, the journey was often protracted to seven,
eight, or ten days. With such public conveyances, great
people&mdash;for even then the world was divided into the
great and little, as it is now&mdash;travelled in their own carriages.</p>

<p>About this time&mdash;it must have been in the summer of
1804&mdash;I remember Jerome Bonaparte coming up to
Keeler's tavern with a coach and four, attended by his
young wife, Miss Patterson of Baltimore. It was a gay
establishment, and the honeymoon sat happily on the
tall, sallow stripling and his young bride. You must remember
that Napoleon was then filling the world with
his fame: at this moment his feet were on the threshold
of the empire. The arrival of his brother in the United
States of course made a sensation. His marriage, his
movements, all were gossipped over from Maine to
Georgia, the extreme points of the Union. His entrance
into Ridgefield produced a flutter of excitement even there.
A crowd gathered around Keeler's tavern to catch a sight
of the strangers, and I was among the rest. I had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
good look at Jerome, who was the chief object of interest,
and the image never faded from my recollection.</p>

<p>Half a century later, I was one evening at the Tuileries,
amid the flush and the fair of Louis Napoleon's new
court. Among them I saw an old man, taller than the
mass around&mdash;his nose and chin almost meeting in contact,
while his toothless gums were "munching the airy
meal of dotage and decrepitude." I was irresistibly
chained to this object, as if a spectre had risen up
through the floor and stood among the garish throng.
My memory travelled back&mdash;back among the winding
labyrinths of years. Suddenly I found the clue: the
stranger was Jerome Bonaparte!</p>

<p>Ah, what a history lay between the past and present&mdash;a
lapse of nearly fifty years. What a difference between
him then and now! Then he was a gay and gallant
bridegroom; now, though he had the title of king,
he was throneless and sceptreless&mdash;an Invalid Governor
of Invalids&mdash;the puppet and pageant of an adventurer,
whose power lay in the mere magic of a name.</p>

<p>About this time, as I well remember, Oliver Wolcott
passed through our village. He arrived at the tavern
late on Saturday evening, but he called at our house in
the morning, his family being connected with ours. He
was a great man then; for not only are the Wolcotts
traditionally and historically a distinguished race in
Connecticut, but he had recently been a member of
Washington's cabinet. I mention him now only for the
purpose of noting his deference to public opinion,
characteristic of the eminent men of that day. In the
morning he went to church, but immediately after the
sermon he had his horses brought up, and proceeded on
his way. He, however, had requested my father to state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to his people, at the opening of the afternoon service, that
he was travelling on public business, and though he regretted
it, he was obliged to continue his journey on the
Sabbath. This my father did, but Deacon Olmstead, the
Jeremiah of the parish, shook his white locks, and lifted
up his voice against such a desecration of the Lord's day.
Some years after, as I remember, Lieutenant-Governor
Treadwell arrived at Keeler's tavern on Saturday evening,
and prepared to prosecute his journey the next
morning, his daughter, who was with him, being ill.
This same Deacon Olmstead called upon him, and said,
"Sir, if you thus set the example of violation of the
Sabbath, you must expect to get one vote less at the next
election!" The Governor was so much struck by the
appearance of the deacon, who was the very image of a
patriarch or a prophet, that he deferred his departure till
Monday.</p>

<p>Although great people rode in their own carriages, the
principal method of travelling was on horseback. Many
of the members of Congress came to Washington in this
way. I have a dim recollection of seeing one day, when
I was trudging along to school, a tall, pale, gaunt man,
approaching on horseback, with his plump saddlebags
behind him. I looked at him keenly, and made my
obeisance, as in duty bound. He lifted his hat, and
bowed in return. By a quick instinct, I sat him down
as a man of mark. In the evening, Lieutenant Smith
came to our house and told us that Timothy Pickering
had passed through the town! He had seen him, and
talked with him, and was vastly distended with the portentous
news thereby acquired, including the rise and
fall of empires for ages to come, and all of which he duly
unfolded to our family circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Before I proceed, let me note, in passing, a point of
manners then universal, but which has now nearly faded
away. When travellers met on the highway, they saluted
each other with a certain dignified and formal courtesy.
All children were regularly taught at school to "make
their manners" to strangers; the boys to bow, and the
girls to courtesy. It was something different from the
frank, familiar, "How are you, stranger?" of the Far
West; something different from the "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon jour, serviteur</i>,"
of the Alps. Our salute was more measured and
formal; respect to age and authority being evidently an
element of this homage, which was sedulously taught to
the young.</p>

<p>For children to salute travellers was, in my early days,
as well a duty as a decency. A child who did not
"make his manners" to a stranger on the high-road was
deemed a low fellow; a stranger who refused to acknowledge
this civility was esteemed a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans culotte</i>, perhaps a
favorer of Jacobinism.</p>

<p>But I must return to locomotion. In Ridgefield, in
the year 1800, there was but a single chaise, and that
belonged to Colonel Bradley, one of the principal citizens
of the place. It was without a top, and had a pair of
wide-spreading, asinine ears. That multitudinous generation
of travelling vehicles, so universal and so convenient
now&mdash;such as top-wagons, four-wheeled chaises,
tilburies, dearborns, &amp;c., was totally unknown. Even if
these things had been invented, the roads would scarcely
have permitted the use of them. Physicians who had
occasion to go from town to town went on horseback;
all clergymen, except perhaps Bishop Seabury, who rode
in a coach, travelled in the same way. My father's people,
who lived at a distance, came to church on horseback;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
their wives and daughters being seated on pillions
behind them. In a few cases&mdash;as in spring-time, when
the mud was bottomless&mdash;the farm wagon was used for
transporting the family.</p>

<p>In winter it was otherwise, for we had three or four
months of sleighing. Then the whole country was a
railroad, and gay times we had. Oh! those beautiful
winters, which would drive me shivering to the fireside
now: what vivid delight have I had in their slidings and
skatings, their sleddings and sleighings! One thing
strikes me now with wonder, and that is, the general indifference
in those days to the intensity of winter. No
doubt, as I have said before, the climate was then more
severe; but, be that as it may, people seemed to suffer
less from it than at the present day. Nobody thought
of staying at home from church because of the extremity
of the weather. We had no thermometers, it is true, to
frighten us with the revelation that it was twenty-five
degrees below zero. The habits of the people were simple
and hardy, and there were few defences against the
assaults of the seasons. The houses were not tight; we
had no stoves, no Lehigh or Lackawanna coal; yet we
lived, and comfortably, too: nay, we even changed burly
winter into a season of enjoyment.</p>

<p>I have said that, in the year 1800, there was but a
single chaise in Ridgefield; and this was brought, I believe,
from New Haven. There was not, I imagine, a
coach, or any kind of pleasure-vehicle&mdash;that crazy old
chaise excepted&mdash;in the county of Fairfield, out of the
two half-shire towns. Such things, indeed, were known
at New York, Boston, and Philadelphia; for already the
government had laid a tax upon pleasure conveyances:
but they were comparatively few in number, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
mostly imported. In 1798 there was but one public
hack in New Haven, and but one coach; the latter, belonging
to Pierpoint Edwards, was a large, four-wheeled
vehicle, for two persons, called a chariot. In the smaller
towns there were no pleasure vehicles in use throughout
New England.</p>

<p>About that time there came to our village a man by
the name of Jesse Skellinger, an Englishman, and
chaisemaker by trade. My father engaged him to build
him a chaise. A bench was set up in our barn, and certain
trees of oak and ash were cut in our neighboring
woods. These were sawed and seasoned, and shaped
into wheels and shafts. Thomas Hawley, half blacksmith,
and half wheelwright, was duly initiated, and he
cunningly wrought the iron necessary for the work. In
five months the chaise was finished, with a standing top;
greatly to the admiration of our family. What a gaze
was there, as this vehicle went through Ridgefield street
upon its first expedition!</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the chaise-manufactory in
Ridgefield, which has since been a source of large revenue
to the town. Skellinger was engaged by Elijah
Hawley, who had formerly done something as a wagon-builder;
and thus in due time an establishment was
founded, which for many years was noted for the beauty
and excellence of its pleasure vehicles.</p>

<p>Ridgefield, as well as most other places, had its Up-town
and Down-town; terms which have not unfrequently
been the occasion of serious divisions in the
affairs of Church and State. In London this distinction
takes the name of West End and the City. The French
philosophers say that every great capital has similar
divisions; West End being always the residence of the
aristocracy, and East End of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</i>.</p>

<p>Ridgefield, being a village, had a right to follow its
own whim; and therefore West Lane, instead of being
the aristocratic end of the place, was really rather the
low end. It constituted, in fact, what was called <i>Down-town</i>,
in distinction from the more eastern and northern
section, called <i>Up-town</i>. In this latter portion, and
about the middle of the main street, was the Up-town
school, the leading seminary of the village; for at this
period it had not arrived at the honors of an academy.
At the age of ten years I was sent here, the institution
being then, and for many years after, under the charge
of Master Stebbins. He was a man with a conciliating
stoop in the shoulders, a long body, short legs, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
swaying walk. He was at this period some fifty years
old, his hair being thin and silvery, and always falling
in well-combed rolls over his coat-collar. His eyes
were blue, and his dress invariably of the same color.
Breeches and knee-buckles, blue-mixed stockings, and
shoes with bright buckles, seemed as much a part of the
man as his head and shoulders. On the whole, his appearance
was that of the middle-class gentleman of the
olden time; and he was, in fact, what he seemed.</p>

<p>This seminary of learning for the rising aristocracy of
Ridgefield was a wooden edifice, thirty by twenty feet,
covered with brown clapboards, and, except an entry,
consisted of a single room. Around, and against the
walls, ran a continuous line of seats, fronted by a continuous
writing-desk. Beneath were depositories for
books and writing materials. The centre was occupied
by slab seats, similar to those of West Lane. The
larger scholars were ranged on the outer sides, at the
desks; the smaller fry of abecedarians were seated in
the centre. The master was enshrined on the east side
of the room, and, regular as the sun, he was in his seat
at nine o'clock, and the performances of the school
began.</p>

<p>According to the Catechism, which we learned and
recited on Saturday, the chief end of man was to glorify
God and keep His commandments; according to the
routine of this school, one would have thought it to be
reading, writing, and arithmetic, to which we may add
spelling. From morning to night, in all weathers,
through every season of the year, these exercises were
carried on with the energy, patience, and perseverance
of a manufactory.</p>

<p>Master Stebbins respected his calling: his heart was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in his work; and so, what he pretended to teach, he
taught well. When I entered the school, I found that a
huge stride had been achieved in the march of mind
since I left West Lane. Webster's Spelling-book had
taken the place of Dilworth, which was a great improvement.
The drill in spelling was very thorough,
and applied every day to the whole school. I imagine
that the exercises might have been amusing to a stranger,
especially as one scholar would sometimes go off in a
voice as grum as that of a bull-frog, while another would
follow in tones as fine and piping as those of a peet-weet.
The blunders, too, were often very ludicrous; even we
children would sometimes have tittered, had not such an
enormity been certain to have brought out the birch.
As to rewards and punishments, the system was this:
whoever missed, went down; so that perfection mounted
to the top. Here was the beginning of the up and down
of life.</p>

<p>Reading was performed in classes, which generally
plodded on without a hint from the master. Nevertheless,
when Zeek Sanford&mdash;who was said to have "a streak
of lightning in him"&mdash;in his haste to be smart, read the
37th verse of the 2nd chapter of the Acts,&mdash;"Now when
they heard this, they were <i>pickled</i> in their heart,"&mdash;the
birch stick on Master Stebbins's table seemed to quiver
and peel at the little end, as if to give warning of the
wrath to come. When Orry Keeler&mdash;Orry was a girl,
you know, and not a boy&mdash;drawled out in spelling,
"k&mdash;o&mdash;n, <i>kon</i>, s&mdash;h&mdash;u&mdash;n&mdash;t&mdash;s, <i>shunts</i>, konshunts,"
the bristles in the master's eyebrows fidgeted like Aunt
Delight's knitting-needles. Occasionally, when the reading
was insupportably bad, he took a book, and himself
read as an example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Master Stebbins was a great man with a slate and pencil,
and I have an idea that we were a generation after
his own heart. We certainly achieved wonders in arithmetic,
according to our own conceptions, some of us
going even beyond the Rule of Three, and making forays
into the mysterious regions of Vulgar Fractions.</p>

<p>But, after all, penmanship was Master Stebbins's great
accomplishment. He had no pompous lessons upon single
lines and bifid lines, and the like. The revelations
of inspired copy-book makers had not then been vouchsafed
to man. He could not cut an American eagle with
a single flourish of a goose-quill. He was guided by
good taste and native instinct, and wrote a smooth round
hand, like copper-plate. His lessons from A to &amp;, all
written by himself, consisted of pithy proverbs and useful
moral lessons. On every page of our writing-books he
wrote the first line himself. The effect was what might
have been expected&mdash;with such models, patiently enforced,
nearly all became good writers.</p>

<p>Beyond these simple elements, the Up-town school
made few pretensions. When I was there, two Webster's
Grammars and one or two Dwight's Geographies
were in use. The latter was without maps or illustrations,
and was, in fact, little more than an expanded table
of contents, taken from Morse's Universal Geography&mdash;the
mammoth monument of American learning and
genius of that age and generation. The grammar was a
clever book, but I have an idea that neither Master Stebbins
nor his pupils ever fathomed its depths. They
floundered about in it, as if in a quagmire, and after some
time came out pretty nearly where they went in, though
perhaps a little confused by the din and dusky atmosphere
of these labyrinths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Let me here repeat an anecdote, which I have indeed
told before, but which I had from the lips of its hero, a
clergyman, of some note thirty years ago, and which
well illustrates this part of my story. At a village school,
not many miles from Ridgefield, he was put into Webster's
Grammar. Here he read, "<i>A noun is the name of
a thing&mdash;as horse, hair, justice</i>." Now, in his innocence,
he read it thus: "<i>A noun is the name of a thing&mdash;as
horse-hair justice</i>."</p>

<p>"What, then," said he, ruminating deeply, "is a
noun? But first I must find out what a horse-hair justice
is."</p>

<p>Upon this he meditated for some days, but still he was
as far as ever from the solution. Now, his father was a
man of authority in those parts, and, moreover, he was a
justice of the peace. Withal, he was of respectable ancestry,
and so there had descended to him a stately high-backed
settee, covered with horse-hair. One day, as the
youth came from school, pondering upon the great grammatical
problem, he entered the front door of the house,
and there he saw before him his father, officiating in his
legal capacity, and seated upon the old horse-hair settee.
"I have found it!" said the boy to himself, greatly delighted&mdash;"my
father is a horse-hair justice, and therefore
a noun!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it must be admitted that the world got
on remarkably well in spite of this narrowness of the
country schools. The elements of an English education
were pretty well taught throughout the village seminaries
of Connecticut, and, I may add, of New England. The
teachers were heartily devoted to their profession: they
respected their calling, and were respected and encouraged
by the community. They had this merit, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
while they attempted little, that, at least, was thoroughly
performed.</p>

<p>I went steadily to the Up-town school for three winters;
being occupied during the summers upon the farm,
and in various minor duties. I was a great deal on
horseback, often carrying messages to the neighboring
towns of Reading, Wilton, Weston, and Lower Salem,
for then the post routes were few, and the mails, which
were weekly, crept like snails over hill and valley. I became
a bold rider at an early age: before I was eight
years old I frequently ventured to put a horse to his
speed, and that, too, without a saddle. A person who
has never tried it, can hardly conceive the wild delight
of riding a swift horse, when he lays down his ears, tosses
his tail in air, and stretches himself out in a full race.
The intense energy of the beast's movements, the rush of
the air, the swimming backward of lands, houses, and
trees, with the clattering thunder of the hoofs&mdash;all convey
to the rider a fierce ecstasy, which, perhaps, nothing
else can give. About this period, however, I received a
lesson, which lasted me a lifetime.</p>

<p>You must know that Deacon Benedict, one of our
neighbors, had a fellow living with him named Abijah.
He was an adventurous youth, and more than once led
me into tribulation. I remember that on one occasion I
went with him to shoot a dog that was said to worry the
deacon's sheep. It was night, and dark as Egypt, but
Bige said he could see the creature close to the cow-house,
behind the barn. He banged away, and then
jumped over the fence, to pick up the game. After a
time he came back, but said not a word. Next morning
it was found that he had shot the brindled cow; mistaking
a white spot in her forehead for the dog, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
taken a deadly aim, and put the whole charge into her
pate. Fortunately her skull was thick and the shot
small, so the honest creature was only a little cracked.
Bige, however, was terribly scolded by the deacon, who
was a justice of the peace, and had a deep sense of the
importance of his duties. I came in for a share of
blame, though I was only a looker-on. Bige said the
deacon called me a "parsnip scrimmage," but more probably
it was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">particeps criminis</i>.</p>

<p>But to proceed. One day I was taking home from the
pasture a horse that belonged to some clergyman&mdash;I
believe Dr. Ripley, of Greensfarms. Just as I came upon
the level ground in front of Jerry Mead's old house,
Bige came up behind me on the deacon's mare&mdash;an
ambling brute with a bushy tail and shaggy mane. As
he approached he gave a chirrup, and my horse, half in
fright and half in fun, bounded away, like Tam
O'Shanter's mare. Away we went, I holding on as well
as I could, for the animal was round as a barrel. He
was no doubt used to a frolic of this sort, although he
belonged to a doctor of divinity, and looked as if he believed
in total depravity. When he finally broke into a
gallop he flew like the wind, at the same time bounding
up and down with a tearing energy, quite frightful to
think of. After a short race he went from under me, and
I came with a terrible shock to the ground.</p>

<p>The breath was knocked out of me for some seconds,
and as I recovered it with a gasping effort, my sensations
were indescribably agonizing. Greatly humbled and
sorely bruised, I managed to get home, where the story
of my adventure had preceded me. I was severely
lectured by my parents, which, however, I might have
forgotten, had not the concussion made an indelible impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
on my memory, thus perpetuating the wholesome
counsel.</p>

<p>When I was about twelve years old, a man by the
name of Sackett was employed to keep a high-school, or,
as it was then called, an academy. Here I went irregularly
for a few weeks, and at a public exhibition I remember
to have spoken a piece, upon a stage fitted up in the
meeting-house, entitled "Charles Chatterbox." This was
the substance of my achievements at Sackett's seminary.</p>

<p>The narrowness of my father's income, and the needs
of a large family, induced him to take half-a-dozen pupils
to be fitted for college. This he continued for a series of
years. It might seem natural that I should have shared
in these advantages; but, in the first place, my only and
elder brother, Charles A. Goodrich&mdash;now widely known
by his numerous useful publications&mdash;had been destined
for the clerical profession, partly by his own predilection,
partly by encouragement from a relative, and partly, too,
from an idea that his somewhat delicate constitution forbade
a more hardy career. To this may doubtless be
added the natural desire of his parents that at least one
of their sons should follow the honored calling to which
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had been
devoted. Hence he was put in training for college. The
expenses to be thus incurred were formidable enough to
my parents, without adding to them by attempting anything
of the kind for me. And, besides, I had manifested
no love of study, and evidently preferred action to
books. Moreover, it must be remembered, that I was
regarded as a born carpenter, and it would have seemed
tempting Providence to have set me upon any other
career. So, with perfect content on my part, from the
age of twelve to fourteen, I was chiefly employed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
active services about the house and farm. I could read,
write, and cipher; this was sufficient for my ambition,
and satisfactory to my parents, in view of the life to
which I was apparently destined.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though my school exercises were such as
I have described, I doubtless gathered some little odds
and ends of learning about those days, beyond the range
of my horn-books. I heard a good deal of conversation
from the clergymen who visited us, and, above all, I
listened to the long discourses of Lieutenant Smith upon
matters and things in general. My father, too, had a
brother in Congress, from whom he received letters,
documents, and messages, all of which became subjects
of discussion. I remember, further, that out of some
childish imitation, I thumbed over Corderius and Erasmus&mdash;the
first Latin books, then constantly in the hands
of my father's pupils. I was so accustomed to hear them
recite their lessons in Virgil, that</p>

<p class="center">
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tityre, tu patulæ recubans sub tegmine fagi</i>&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>and</p>

<p class="center">
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arma</i>, arms&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">virumque</i>, and the man&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cano</i>, I sing,<br />
</p>

<p>were as familiar to my ears as <i>hillery, tillery, zachery zan</i>,
and probably conveyed to my mind about as much meaning.
Even the first lesson in Greek&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<span lang="gr" xml:lang="gr">&#917;&#957;</span>, in&mdash;<span lang="gr" xml:lang="gr">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#942;</span>,
the beginning&mdash;<span lang="gr" xml:lang="gr">&#7968;&#957;</span>,
was&mdash;<span lang="gr" xml:lang="gr">&#8001; &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>, the Word&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>was also among the cabalistic jingles in my memory. All
this may seem nothing as a matter of education; still,
some years after, while I was an apprentice in Hartford,
feeling painfully impressed with the scantiness of my
knowledge, I borrowed some Latin school-books, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the idea of attempting to master that language. To my
delight and surprise, I found that they seemed familiar
to me. Thus encouraged, I began, and bending steadily
over my task at evening, when my day's duties were
over, I made my way nearly through the Latin Grammar
and the first two books of Virgil's <cite>Æneid</cite>. In my
poverty of knowledge, even these acquisitions became
useful to me.</p>

<p>From the age of twelve to fifteen, though generally
occupied in the various tasks assigned me, I still found a
good deal of time to ramble over the country. Whole
days I spent in the long, lonesome lanes that wound between
Ridgefield and Salem, in the half-cultivated, half-wooded
hills that lay at the foot of West Mountain, and
in the deep recesses of the wild and rugged regions beyond.
I frequently climbed to the tops of the cliffs and
ridges that rose one above another; and having gained
the crown of the mountain, cast long and wistful glances
over the blue vale that stretched out for many miles to
the westward. I had always my gun in hand, and
though not insensible to any sport that might fall in my
way, I was more absorbed in the fancies that came
thronging to my imagination. Thus I became familiar
with the whole country around, and especially with the
shaded glens and gorges of West Mountain. I must add
that these had, besides their native, savage charms, a
sort of fascination from being the residence of a strange
woman, who had devoted herself to solitude, and was
known under the name of "the Hermitess." This personage
I had occasionally seen in our village; and I
frequently met her as she glided through the forests,
while I was pursuing my mountain rambles. I sometimes
felt a strange thrill as she passed; but this only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
seemed to render the recesses where she dwelt still more
inviting.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that I inherited from my mother a
love of the night side of nature; not a love that begets
melancholy, but an appetite that found pleasure in the
shadows, as well as the lights, of life and imagination.
Eminently practical as she was&mdash;laborious, skilful, and
successful in the duties which Providence had assigned
her, as the head of a large family, with narrow means&mdash;she
was still of a poetic temperament. Her lively fancy
was vividly set forth by a pair of the finest eyes I have
ever seen; dark and serious, yet tender and sentimental.
These bespoke, not only the vigor of her conceptions,
but the melancholy tinge that shaded her imagination.
Sometimes, indeed, the well of sadness in her heart became
full, and it ran over in tears. These, however,
were like spring showers; brief in duration, and afterwards
brightening to all around. She was not the only
woman who has felt better after a good cry. It was, in
fact, a poetic, not a real sorrow, that thus excited her
emotions; for her prevailing humor abounded in wit and
vivacity, not unfrequently taking the hue of playful
satire. Nevertheless, her taste craved the pathetic, the
mournful; not as a bitter medicine, but a spicy condiment.
Her favorite poets were King David and Dr.
Watts: she preferred the dirge-like melody of Windham
to all other music. All the songs she sang were minors.</p>

<p>You will gather, from what I have said, that my father
not only prayed in his family night and morning, but before
breakfast, and immediately after the household was
assembled he always read a chapter in the sacred volume.
It is recorded in our family Bible, that he read it
through, in course, thirteen times in the space of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
five-and-twenty years. He was an excellent reader, having
a remarkably clear, frank, hearty voice; so that I
was deeply interested, and thus early became familiar
with almost every portion of the Old and New Testament.</p>

<p>The practice of family worship, as I before stated, was
at this time very general in New England. In Ridgefield,
it was not altogether confined to the strictly religious;
to clergymen, deacons, and church members. It was a
custom which decency hardly allowed to be omitted.
No family was thought to go on well without it. There
is a good story which well describes this trait of manners.</p>

<p>Somewhere in Vermont, in this golden age, there was
a widow by the name of Bennett. In consequence of
the death of her husband, the charge of a large farm
and an ample household devolved upon her. Her husband
had been a pious man, and all things had prospered
with him. His widow, alike from religious feeling and
affectionate regard for his memory, desired that everything
should be conducted as much as possible as it had
been during his lifetime. Especially did she wish the
day to begin and close with family worship.</p>

<p>Now, she had a foreman on the farm by the name of
Ward. He was a good man for work, but he was not a
religious man. In vain did the widow, in admitting his
merits at the plough, the scythe, and the flail, still urge
him to crown her wishes, by leading in family prayer.
For a long time the heart of the man was hard, and his
ear deaf to her entreaties. At last, however, wearied
with her importunities, he seemed to change, and, to her
great joy, consented to make a trial.</p>

<p>On a bright morning in June&mdash;at early sunrise&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
family were all assembled in the parlor, men and
maidens, for their devotions. When all was ready,
Ward, in a low, troubled voice, began. He had never
prayed, or at least not in public, but he had heard many
prayers, and possessed a retentive memory. After getting
over the first hesitancy, he soon became fluent, and
taking passages here and there from the various petitions
he had heard&mdash;Presbyterian, Methodist, Universalist,
and Episcopalian&mdash;he went on with great eloquence,
gradually elevating his tone and accelerating his delivery.
Ere long his voice grew portentous, and some of the
men and maids, thinking he was suddenly taken either
mad or inspired, stole out on their toes into the kitchen,
where, with gaping mouths, they awaited the result.
The Widow Bennett bore it all for about half an hour;
but at last, as the precious time was passing away, she
lost patience, and sprang to her feet. Placing herself
directly in front of the speaker, she exclaimed, "Ward,
what do you mean?"</p>

<p>As if suddenly relieved from a nightmare, he exclaimed,
"Oh dear, ma'am, I'm much obliged to you;
for somehow I couldn't wind the thing off."</p>

<p>I must not pass over another incident having reference
to the topic in question. Under the biblical influence
of those days my father's scholars built a temple of the
Philistines, and when it was completed within and without,
all the children round about assembled, as did the
Gazaites of old. The edifice was chiefly of boards, slenderly
constructed, and reached the height of twelve feet;
nevertheless, all of us got upon it, according to the 16th
chapter of Judges. The oldest of the scholars played
Samson. When all was ready, he took hold of the pillars
of the temple, one with his right hand and one with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
his left. "Let me die with the Philistines!" said he,
and bowing himself, down we came in a heap! Strange
to say, nobody but Samson was hurt, and he only in
some skin bruises. If you could see him now&mdash;dignified
even to solemnity, and seldom condescending to any but
the gravest matters&mdash;you would scarcely believe the
story, even though I write it and verify it. Nevertheless,
if he must have played, he should have taken the
part of Samson, for he is one of the most gifted men I
have ever known.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hang">THE CLERGY OF FAIRFIELD&mdash;A LAUGHING PARSON&mdash;THE THREE DEACONS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before I complete my narrative so far as it relates to
Ridgefield, I should state that in the olden time a country
minister's home was a ministers' tavern, and therefore I
saw at our house, at different periods, most of the
orthodox or Congregational clergymen belonging to that
part of the State. My father frequently exchanged with
those of the neighboring towns, and sometimes consociations
and associations were held at Ridgefield. Thus,
men of the clerical profession constituted a large portion
of the strangers who visited us. I may add that my
lineage was highly ministerial, from an early period down
to my own time. The pulpit of Durham, filled by my
paternal grandfather, continued in the same family one
hundred and twenty-six consecutive years. A short time
since we reckoned among our relations, not going beyond
the degree of second cousin, more than a dozen ministers
of the Gospel, and all of the same creed.</p>

<p>As to the clergy of Fairfield county, my boyish impressions
of them were, that they were of the salt of the
earth; nor has a larger experience altered my opinion.
If I sometimes indulge a smile at the recollection of
particular traits of character, or more general points of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
manner significant of the age, I still regard them with
affection and reverence.</p>

<p>I need not tell you that they were counsellors in religious
matters, in the dark and anxious periods of the
spirit, in times of sickness, at the approach of death.
They sanctified the wedding, not refusing afterward to
countenance the festivity which naturally ensued. They
administered baptism, but only upon adults who made a
profession, or upon the children of professors. I may
add that, despite their divinity, they were sociable in their
manners and intercourse. The state of the Church was
no doubt first in their minds, but ample room was left
for the good things of life. Those who came to our
house examined my brother in his Greek and Latin, and
I went out behind the barn to gather tansy for their
morning bitters. They dearly loved a joke, and relished
anecdotes, especially if they bore a little hard upon the
cloth. The following will suffice as a specimen of the
stories they delighted in.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a clergyman&mdash;the Rev.
Dr. T&mdash;&mdash;, a man of high character, and distinguished
for his dignity of manner. But it was remarked that
frequently as he was ascending the pulpit stairs he would
smile, and sometimes almost titter, as if beset by an uncontrollable
desire to laugh. This excited remark, and
at last scandal. Finally, it was thought necessary for
some of his clerical friends, at a meeting of the Association,
to bring up the matter for consideration.</p>

<p>The case was stated, the Rev. Dr. T&mdash;&mdash; being present.
"Well, gentlemen," said he, "the fact charged against
me is true, but I beg you to permit me to offer an explanation.
A few months after I was licensed to preach I was
in a country town, and on a Sabbath morning was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to enter upon the services of the church. At the back
of the pulpit was a window, which looked out upon a
field of clover, then in full bloom, for it was summer.
As I rose to commence the reading of the Scriptures, I
cast a glance into the field, and there I saw a man performing
the most extraordinary evolutions&mdash;jumping,
whirling, slapping in all directions, and with a ferocious
agony of exertion. At first I thought he was mad; but
suddenly the truth burst upon me&mdash;he had buttoned up
a bumblebee in his pantaloons! I am constitutionally
nervous, gentlemen, and the shock of this scene upon my
risible sensibilities was so great, that I could hardly get
through the services. Several times I was upon the point
of bursting into a laugh. Even to this day, the remembrance
of this scene, through the temptation of the devil,
often comes upon me as I am ascending the pulpit.
This, I admit, is a weakness, but I trust it will rather
excite your sympathy and your prayers than your reproaches."</p>

<p>It may be amusing, perhaps profitable, to give here a
few sketches of the remarkable characters of Ridgefield,
at the opening of the present century. Some were types
of their time; others, however eccentric, were exemplifications
of our race and our society, influenced by peculiar
circumstances, and showing into what fashions this stuff
of humanity may be wrought. They are still prominent
in my recollection, and seem to me an essential part of
the social landscape which encircled my youth.</p>

<p>I begin with the three deacons of my father's parish.
First was Deacon Olmstead, full threescore years and ten
at the opening of the present century. His infancy
touched upon the verge of Puritanism&mdash;the days of Increase
and Cotton Mather. The spirit of the Puritans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
lived in his heart, while the semblance of the patriarchs
lingered in his form. He was fully six feet high, with
broad shoulders, powerful limbs, and the august step of a
giant. His hair was white, and rolled in thin curls upon
his shoulders; he was still erect, though he carried a
long cane, like that of father Abraham in the old
pictures, representing him at the head of his kindred and
his camels, going from the land of Haran to the land of
Canaan. Indeed, he was my personification of the great
progenitor of the Hebrews; and when my father read
from the twelfth chapter of Genesis, how he and Lot and
their kindred journeyed forth, I half fancied it must be
Deacon Olmstead under another name.</p>

<p><a name="deacon" id="deacon">&nbsp;</a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/i_086.jpg" width="380" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">DEACON OLMSTEAD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Deacon Olmstead was in all things a noble specimen
of humanity&mdash;an honor to human nature, a shining light
in the church. I have spoken of him as having something
grand about him, yet I remember how kindly he
condescended to take me, a child, on his knee, and how
gently his great brawny fingers encircled my infant hand.
I have said he was wise; yet his book-learning was small,
though it might have been as great as that of Abraham,
or Isaac, or Jacob. He knew, indeed, the Bible by heart,
and that is a great teacher. He had also lived long, and
profited by observation and experience. Above all, he
was calm, just, sincere, and it is wonderful how these
lamps light up the path of life. I have said he was
proud, yet it was only toward the seductions of the
world: to these he was hard and stern: to his God he
was simple, obedient, and docile as a child: toward his
kindred and his neighbor, toward the poor, toward the
suffering, though not so soft, he was sympathetic as a
sister of charity.</p>

<p>I must now present a somewhat different portrait&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of Deacon John Benedict. He was a worthy old
man, and enjoyed many claims to respect. He was not
only a deacon, but a justice of the peace; moreover, he
was the father of Aunt Delight, of whom I desire ever
to speak with reverence. She, not being a beauty, was
never married, and hence, having no children of her
own, she combed and crammed the heads of other people's
children. In this way she was eminently useful in
her day and generation. The Deacon respected the law,
especially as it was administered in his own person. He
was severe upon those who violated the statutes of the
State, but one who violated the statutes of Deacon John
Benedict committed the unpardonable sin. He was the
entire police of the meeting-house on Sunday, and not a
boy or girl, or even a bumblebee, could offend without
condign punishment.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Deacon is said, in one case&mdash;rather
before my time&mdash;to have met his match. There was in
the village a small, smart, nervous woman, with a vigorous
clack, which, once set going, was hard to stop. One
day she was at church, and having carried her dinner of
mince-pie in a little cross-handled basket, she set it down
under the seat. In the midst of sermon-time a small
dog came into the pew, and getting behind her petticoats,
began to devour the pie. She heard what was
going on, and gave him a kick. Upon this the dog
backed out with a yelp, taking with him the dinner-basket,
hung about his neck, across the pew into the
broad aisle.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said the woman, in a shrill voice, "the
dog's got my dinner! There! I've spoken loud in
meeting-time! What will Deacon Benedict say? Why!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
I'm talking all the time. There it goes agin! What
shall I du?"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" said the Deacon, who was in
his official seat, fronting the explosion. These words
operated like a charm, and the nervous lady was silent.
The next day Deacon John appeared at the house of the
offender, carrying a calf-bound volume in his hand. The
woman gave one glance at the book, and one at the
Deacon. That was enough: it spoke volumes, and the
man of the law returned home, and never mentioned the
subject afterward.</p>

<p>Deacon Hawley was very unlike either of his two associates
whom I have described. He was younger, and of
a peculiarly mild and amiable temper. His countenance
wore a tranquil and smooth expression. His hair was
fine and silky, and lay, as if oiled, close to his head. He
had a soft voice, and an ear for music. He was a cabinet-maker
by trade, a chorister by choice, and a deacon by
the vote of the church. In each of these things he found
his place, as if designed for it by nature.</p>

<p>In worldly affairs as well as spiritual, Deacon Hawley's
path was straight and even: he was successful in business,
beloved in society, honored in the church. Exceedingly
frugal by habit and disposition, he still loved to
give in charity, though he did not talk of it. When he
was old, his family being well provided for, he spent
much of his time in casting about to find opportunities
of doing good. Once he learned that a widow, who had
been in good circumstances, was struggling with poverty.
He was afraid to offer money as charity, for fear of
wounding her pride&mdash;the more sensitive, perhaps, because
of her change of condition. He therefore intimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that he owed a debt of fifty dollars to her late
husband, and wished to pay it to her.</p>

<p>"And how was that?" said the lady, somewhat
startled.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said the Deacon. "About five-and-twenty
years ago, soon after you were married, I made
some furniture for your husband&mdash;to the amount of two
hundred dollars. I have been looking over the account,
and find that I rather overcharged him in the price of
some chairs&mdash;that is, I could have afforded them at
somewhat less. I have added up the interest, and here,
madam, is the money."</p>

<p>The widow listened, and as she suspected the truth,
the tears came to her eyes. The Deacon did not
pause to reply, but laid the money on the table and departed.</p>

<p>The term <i>deacon</i> is associated in many minds with a
sort of affectation, a cant in conversation, and an I-am-holier-than-thou
air and manner. I remember Deacon
C&mdash;&mdash;, who deemed it proper to become scriptural, and
talk as much as possible like Isaiah. He was in partnership
with his son Laertes, and they sold crockery and
furniture. One day a female customer came, and the old
gentleman being engaged, went to call his son, who was
in the loft above. Placing himself at the foot of the
stairs, he said, attuning his voice to the occasion,
"La-ar-tes, descend&mdash;a lady waits!" Deacon C&mdash;&mdash; sought
to signalize himself by a special respect to the
ways of Providence; so he refused to be insured against
fire, declaring that if the Lord wished to burn down his
house or his barn he should submit without a murmur.
He pretended to consider thunder, and lightning, and
conflagrations as special acts of the Almighty, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
distrusting Providence to attempt to avert their effects.
Deacon Hawley had none of these follies or frailties.
Though a deacon, he was still a man; though aspiring to
heaven, he lived cheerily on earth; though a Christian,
he was a father, a neighbor, and, according to
his rank in life, a gentleman, having in all things the
feelings and manners appropriate to each of those relations.</p>

<p class="hang">MAT OLMSTEAD, THE TOWN WIT&mdash;THE SALAMANDER HAT&mdash;SOLAR ECLIPSE&mdash;THE
OLD HEN AND THE PHILOSOPHER&mdash;LIEUTENANT SMITH&mdash;EXTRAORDINARY
METEOR&mdash;FULTON AND HIS STEAM-BOAT&mdash;GRANTHER BALDWIN
AND HIS WIFE&mdash;SARAH BISHOP AND HER CAVE.</p></blockquote>


<p>Another celebrity in Ridgefield, whom I must not
forget, was Matthew Olmstead, or Mat Olmstead, as he
was usually called; he was a day laborer, and though his
specialty was the laying of stone fences, he was equally
adroit at hoeing corn, mowing, and farm-work in general.
He was rather short and thick-set, with a long nose, a
little bulbous in his latter days; with a ruddy complexion,
and a mouth shutting like a pair of nippers, the lips
having an oblique dip to the left, giving a keen and mischievous
expression to his face: qualified, however, by
more of mirth than malice. This feature was indicative
of his mind and character; for he was sharp in speech,
and affected a crisp, biting brevity, called dry wit. He
had also a turn for practical jokes, and a great many of
these were told of him; to which, perhaps, he had no
historical claim. The following is one of them, and is
illustrative of his manner, even if it originated elsewhere.</p>

<p>On a cold, stormy day in December, a man chanced to
come into the bar-room of Keeler's tavern, where Mat
Olmstead and several of his companions were lounging.
The stranger had on a new hat of the latest fashion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
still shining with the gloss of the iron. He seemed conscious
of his dignity, and carried his head in such a manner
as to invite attention to it. Mat's knowing eye
immediately detected the weakness of the stranger; so
he approached him, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a very nice hat you've got on! Pray who
made it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it came from New York," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Well, let me take it," said Mat.</p>

<p>The stranger took it off his head, gingerly, and handed
it to him.</p>

<p>"It is a wonderful nice hat," said Matthew; "and I
see it's a real salamander!"</p>

<p>"Salamander?" said the other. "What's that?"</p>

<p>"Why, a real salamander hat won't burn!"</p>

<p>"No? I never heard of that before: I don't believe
it's one of that kind."</p>

<p>"Sartain sure; I'll bet you a mug of flip of it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll stand you!"</p>

<p>"Done: now I'll just put it under the fore-stick?"</p>

<p>"Well."</p>

<p>It being thus arranged, Mat put the hat under the
fore-stick into a glowing mass of coals. In an instant it
took fire, collapsed, and rolled into a black, crumpled
mass of cinders.</p>

<p>"I du declare," said Mat Olmstead, affecting great astonishment,
"it ain't a salamander hat arter all! Well,
I'll pay the flip!"</p>

<p>Yet wit is not always wisdom. Keen as this man was
as to things immediately before him, he was of narrow
understanding. He seemed not to possess the faculty of
reasoning beyond his senses. He never would admit
that the sun was fixed, and that the world turned round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember, that when the great solar eclipse of 1806
was approaching, he with two other men were at work
in one of our fields, not far from the house. The eclipse
was to begin at ten or eleven o'clock, and my father invited
the workmen to come up and observe it through
some pieces of smoked glass. They came, though Mat
ridiculed the idea of an eclipse&mdash;not but the thing might
happen; but it was idle to suppose it could be foretold.
While they were waiting and watching, my father explained
the cause and nature of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Mat laughed with that low, scoffing chuckle, with
which a woodcock, safe in his den, replies to the bark of
a besieging dog.</p>

<p>"So you don't believe this?" said my father.</p>

<p>"No," said Mat, shaking his head; "I don't believe a
word of it. You say, Parson Goodrich, that the sun is
fixed, and don't move?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I say so."</p>

<p>"Well: didn't you preach last Sunday out of the 10th
chapter of Joshua?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And didn't you tell us that Joshua commanded the
sun and moon to stand still?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well: what was the use of telling the sun to stand
still if it never moved?"</p>

<p>This was a dead shot, especially at a parson, and in
the presence of an audience inclined, from the fellowship
of ignorance, to receive the argument. Being thus
successful, Mat went on,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Parson Goodrich, let's try it again. If you
turn a thing that's got water in it bottom up, the water'll
run out, won't it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"No doubt."</p>

<p>"If the world turns round, then, your well will be
turned bottom up, and the water'll run out!"</p>

<p>At this point my father applied his eye to the sun,
through a piece of smoked glass. The eclipse had begun:
a small piece was evidently cut off from the rim.
My father stated the fact, and the company around looked
through the glass, and saw that it was so. Mat Olmstead,
however, sturdily refused to try it, and bore on his
face an air of supreme contempt; as much as to say
"You don't humbug me!"</p>

<p>But ignorance and denial of the works of God do not
interrupt their march. By slow and invisible degrees, a
shade crept over the landscape. There was no cloud in
the sky; but a chill stole through the atmosphere, and a
strange dimness fell over the world. It was mid-day, yet
it seemed like the approach of night. All nature seemed
chilled and awed by the strange phenomenon. The
birds, with startled looks and ominous notes, left their
busy cares and gathered in the thick branches of the
trees, where they seemed to hold counsel one with another.
The hens, with slow and hesitating steps, set
their faces toward their roosts. One old hen, with a
brood of chickens, walked along with a tall, halting
tread, and sought shelter upon the barn-floor, where she
gathered her young ones under her wings, continuing to
made a low sound, as if saying, "Hush, my babes, lie
still and slumber."</p>

<p>I well remember this phenomenon&mdash;the first of the
kind I had ever witnessed. Though occupied by this
seeming conflict of the heavenly bodies, I recollect to
have paid some attention to the effect of the scene upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
others. Mat Olmstead said not a word; the other workmen
were overwhelmed with emotions of awe.</p>

<p>At length, the eclipse began to pass away, and nature
slowly returned to her equanimity. The birds came
forth, and sang a jubilee, as if relieved from some impending
calamity. The hum of life again filled the air;
the old hen with her brood gaily resumed her rambles,
and made the leaves and gravel fly with her invigorated
scratchings. The workmen, too, having taken a glass of
grog, returned thoughtfully to their labors.</p>

<p>"After all," said one of the men, as they passed along
to the field, "I guess the parson was right about the sun
and the moon."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps he was," said Mat; "but then Joshua
was wrong."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This incident of the total eclipse was, many years later,
turned to account in Parley's Magazine, in the following
dialogue between Peter Parley and his children:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Parley.</i> Come, John, you promised to write something
for this number of the Magazine; is it ready?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Well&mdash;* * *&mdash;not exactly.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Oh, Mr. Parley&mdash;'tis ready&mdash;he read it all to
me, and it's real good, if anybody could understand it.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> Bring it here, John. (<i>John comes up gingerly,
and gives Mr. Parley a piece of paper.</i>)</p>

<p><i>John.</i> There 'tis&mdash;but you mustn't read it aloud.</p>

<p><i>All the children.</i> Yes, yes, read it! Read it! Go
ahead!</p>

<p><i>P.</i> Well, I'll read it&mdash;it looks pretty good. Now let
all be perfectly still. (<i>Parley reads.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">REFLECTIONS OF A PHILOSOPHER UPON A BLADE OF GRASS.</p>

<p>Here is a leaf, which we call a blade of grass. There
are myriads like it in this field; it seems a trifle; it
seems insignificant. But let me look at it with my glass.
How wonderful is its texture! It seems woven like network,
and nothing can exceed the beauty of its structure.
And yet every blade of grass is like this. It exceeds
all human art in the delicacy of its fabric, yet it
grows here out of the ground. <em>Grows!</em> What does
that mean? What makes it grow? Has it life? It
must have life, or it could not grow. And what is that
life? It cannot think; it cannot walk; who makes it
grow then? Who made this blade of grass? It was
not man; it is not the beast of the field. It is God who
made it! And is God here in the field, all around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
me&mdash;in every blade of grass, in every leaf, and stem,
and flower?</p>

every thing around us, if we use the powers we possess!</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i> Some people believe, that birds and beasts
have minds and souls as well as human beings; but we
see that the most stupendous wonder of nature excited in
one of the most intelligent and civilized of birds, only a
queer sort of surprise, expressed in the words cut&mdash;cut&mdash;cu&mdash;dawcut!
At the same time it appears that a single
blade of grass opens to the philosopher a sublime strain
of thought, teaching the profound lesson that God is
everywhere!</p>

<p>Is there not a gulf as wide as eternity, between the
human soul and animal instinct?</p>

<p>To return to Mat Olmstead. Notwithstanding his
habitual incredulity, he had still his weak side, for he
was a firm believer in ghosts: not ghosts in general, but
in two that he had seen himself. These were of enormous
size, white, and winged like angels. He had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
them one dark night as he was going to his house, which
was situated in a lonesome lane that diverged from the
high road. It was very late, and Mat had spent the
evening at the tavern, like Tam O'Shanter; like him, he
"was na fou, but just had plenty." Well, Mat Olmstead's
two angels turned out to be a couple of white
geese, which he had startled into flight as he stumbled
upon them quietly snoozing in the joint of a rail fence!</p>

<p>It has often appeared to me that Mat Olmstead was a
type, a representative of a class of men not very rare in
this world of ours. It is not at all uncommon to find
people, and those who are called strong-minded, who are
habitual unbelievers in things possible and probable&mdash;nay,
in things well established by testimony&mdash;while they
readily become the dupes of the most absurd illusions
and impositions. Dr. Johnson, it is stated, did not believe
in the great earthquake of Lisbon in 1755, until six
months after it had happened, while he readily accepted
the egregious deception of the Cock Lane Ghost. In
our day we see people, and sharp ones, too, who reject
the plainest teachings of common sense, sanctioned by
the good and wise of centuries, and follow with implicit
faith some goose of the imagination, like Joe Smith or
Brigham Young. These are Mat Olmsteads, a little intoxicated
by their own imaginations, and in their night
of ignorance and folly they fall down and worship the
grossest and goosiest of illusions.</p>

<p>I now turn to a different character, Lieutenant, or, as
we all called him, <em>Leftenant</em> Smith, who has been already
introduced to you. He was a man of extensive reading
and large information; he was also some sixty years old,
and had stored in his memory the results of his own observation
and experience. He read the newspapers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
conversed with travellers, affected philosophy, and deemed
himself the great intelligencer of the town: he dearly
loved to dispense his learning, asking only in return attentive
listeners; and he liked discussion, provided the
talk was all left to himself. He was equal to all questions:
with my father, he dilated upon such high matters
as the purchase of Louisiana; Lewis and Clarke's exploring
expedition; the death of Hamilton in the duel
with Aaron Burr; the attack of the Leopard on the
Chesapeake; Fulton's attempts at steam navigation, and
the other agitating topics of those times, as they came
one after another.</p>

<p>I have an impression now that Lieut. Smith, after all,
was not very profound; but to me he was a miracle of
learning. I listened to his discussions with very little
interest, but his narratives engaged my whole attention.
These were always descriptive of actual events, for he
would have disdained fiction: from them I derived a
satisfaction that I never found in fables. The travels of
Mungo Park, his strange adventures and melancholy
death, which about those days transpired through the
newspapers, and all of which Lieut. Smith had at his
tongue's end, excited my interest and my imagination,
even beyond the romances of Sinbad the Sailor and
Robinson Crusoe.</p>

<p>In the year 1807 an event occurred, not only startling
in itself, but giving exercise to all the philosophical
powers of Lieut. Smith. On the morning of the 14th of
December, about daybreak, I had arisen, and was occupied
in building a fire, this being my daily duty; suddenly
the room was filled with light, and, looking up, I
saw through the window a ball of fire, nearly the size of
the moon, passing across the heavens from north-west to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
south-east. It was at an immense height, and of intense
brilliancy. Having passed the zenith, it swiftly descended
toward the earth: while still at a great elevation it burst,
with three successive explosions, into fiery fragments.
The report was like three claps of rattling thunder in
quick succession.</p>

<p>My father, who saw the light and heard the sounds,
declared it to be a meteor of extraordinary magnitude.
It was noticed all over the town, and caused great excitement.
On the following day the news came that huge
fragments of stone had fallen in the adjacent town of
Weston, some eight or ten miles south-east of Ridgefield.
It appeared that the people in the neighborhood heard
the rushing of the stones through the air, as well as the
shock when they struck the earth. One, weighing two
hundred pounds, fell on a rock, which it splintered; its
huge fragments ploughing up the ground around to the
extent of a hundred feet. This meteor was estimated to
be half-a-mile in diameter, and to have travelled through
the heavens at the rate of two or three hundred miles a
minute.</p>

<p>On this extraordinary occasion the Lieutenant came
to our house, according to his wont, and for several successive
evenings discoursed to us upon the subject. I
must endeavor to give you a specimen of his performances.</p>

<p>"I have examined the subject, sir," said he, addressing
my father, "and am inclined to the opinion that these
phenomena are animals revolving in the orbits of space
between the heavenly bodies. Occasionally, one of them
comes too near the earth, and rushing through our atmosphere
with immense velocity, takes fire and explodes!"</p>

<p>"This is rather a new theory, is it not?" said my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
father. "It appears that these meteoric stones, in whatever
country they fall, are composed of the same ingredients:
mostly silex, iron, and nickel: these substances
would make rather a hard character, if endowed with
animal life, and especially with the capacity of rushing
through space at the rate of two or three hundred miles
a minute, and then exploding?"</p>

<p>"These substances I consider only as the shell of the
animal, sir."</p>

<p>"You regard the creature as a huge shell-fish, then?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily a fish; for the whole order of nature,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crustacea</i>, has the bones on the outside. In this
case of meteors, I suppose them to be covered with some
softer substance; for it frequently happens that a jelly-like
matter comes down with meteoric stones. This
resembles coagulated blood; and thus what is called
bloody rain or snow has often fallen over great spaces of
country. Now, when the chemists analyze these things&mdash;the
stones, which I consider the bones; and the jelly,
which I consider the fat; and the rain, which I consider
the blood&mdash;they find them all to consist of the same elements;
that is, silex, iron, nickel, &amp;c. None but my
animal theory will harmonise all these phenomena, sir."</p>

<p>"But," interposed my father, "consider the enormous
size of your aërial monsters. I recollect to have read
only a short time since, that in the year 1803, about one
o'clock in the afternoon, the inhabitants of several towns
of Normandy, in France, heard noises in the sky, like the
peals of cannon and musketry, with a long-continued roll
of drums. Looking upward, they saw something like a
small cloud at an immense elevation, which soon seemed
to explode, sending its vapor in all directions. At last a
hissing noise was heard, and then stones fell, spreading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
over a country three miles wide by eight miles long. No
less than two thousand pieces were collected, weighing
from one ounce to seventeen pounds. That must have
been rather a large animal, eight miles long and three
miles wide!"</p>

<p>"What is that, sir, in comparison with the earth,
which Kepler, the greatest philosopher that ever lived,
conceived to be a huge beast?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but did he prove it?"</p>

<p>"He gave good reasons for it, sir. He found very
striking analogies between the earth and animal existences:
such as the tides, indicating its breathing through
vast internal lungs; earthquakes, resembling eructations
from the stomach; and volcanoes, suggestive of boils,
pimples, and other cutaneous eruptions."</p>

<p>"I think I have seen your theory set to verse."</p>

<p>Saying this, my father rose, and bringing a book,
read as follows,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To me things are not as to vulgar eyes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would all nature's works anatomize:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rolling and sporting in the aërial sea:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soil encompasses her rocks and stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As flesh in animals encircles bones.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On her high mountains living forests grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And downy grass o'erspreads the vales below:<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p>My father having closed the book, the profound
Lieutenant, who did not conceive it possible that a thing
so serious could be made the subject of a joke, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A happy illustration of my philosophy, sir, though I
cannot commend the form in which it is put. If a man
has anything worth saying, sir, he should use prose.
Poetry is only proper when one wishes to embellish folly
or dignify trifles. In this case it is otherwise, I admit;
and I am happy to find so powerful a supporter of my
animal theory of meteors. I shall consider the subject,
and present it for the consideration of the philosophic
world."</p>

<p>One prominent characteristic of this philosopher was,
that when a great event came about, he fancied that he
had foreseen and predicted it from the beginning. Now,
about this time Fulton actually succeeded in his long-sought
application of steam to navigation. The general
opinion of the country had been, all along, that he was
a monomaniac, attempting an impossibility. He was the
standing theme of cheap newspaper wit, and a God-send
to orators who were hard run for a joke. Lieutenant
Smith, who was only an echo of what passed around him
during the period of Fulton's labors, joined in the current
contempt; but when the news came, in October,
1807, that he had actually succeeded&mdash;that one of his
boats had steamed at the rate of five miles an hour
against the current of the Hudson river&mdash;then, still an
echo of the public voice, did he greatly jubilate.</p>

<p>"I told you so! I told you so!" was his first exclamation,
as he entered the house, swelling with the account.</p>

<p>"Well, and what is it?" said my father.</p>

<p>"Fulton has made his boat go, sir! I told you how it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
would be, sir. It opens a new era in the history of navigation.
We shall go to Europe in ten days, sir."</p>

<p>Now, you will readily understand, that in these
sketches I do not pretend to report with literal precision
the profound discourses of our Ridgefield <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i>; I remember
only the general outlines, the rest being easily
suggested. My desire is to present the portrait of one
of the notables of our village&mdash;one whom I remember
with pleasure, and whom I conceive to be a representative
of the amiable, and perhaps useful race of fussy
philosophers to be found in most country villages.</p>

<p>From the town oracle I turn to the town miser.
Granther Baldwin, as I remember him, was threescore
years and ten&mdash;perhaps a little more. He was a man of
middle size, thin, wiry, and bloodless, and having his
body bent forward at a sharp angle with his hips, while
his head was thrown back over his shoulders, giving his
person the general form of a reversed letter Z. His
complexion was brown and stony; his eye grey and
twinkling, with a nose and chin almost meeting like a pair
of forceps. His hair, standing out with an irritable friz,
was of a rusty gray. He always walked and rode with
restless rapidity. At church, he wriggled in his seat,
tasted fennel, and bobbed his head up and down and
around. He could not afford tobacco, so he chewed, with
a constant activity, either an oak chip or the roots of elecampane,
which was indigenous in the lane near his house.
On Sundays he was decent in his attire, but on week-days
he was a beggarly curiosity. It was said that he once exchanged
hats with a scarecrow, and cheated scandalously
in the bargain. His boots&mdash;a withered wreck of an
old pair of whitetops&mdash;dangled over his shrunken calves
and a coat in tatters fluttered from his body. He rode a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
rat-tailed, ambling mare, which always went like the wind,
shaking the old gentleman merrily from right to left, and
making his bones, boots, and rags rustle like his own
bush-harrow. Familiar as he was, the school-boys were
never tired of him, and when he passed, "There goes
Granther Baldwin!" was the invariable ejaculation.</p>

<p>I must add, in order to complete the picture, that in
contrast to his leanness and activity, his wife was very
fat, and, either from indolence or lethargy, dozed away
half her life in the chimney-corner. She spent a large
part of her life in cheating her husband out of fourpence-ha'pennies,
of which more than a peck were found
secreted in an old chest at her death.</p>

<p>It was the boast of this man that he had risen from
poverty to wealth, and he loved to describe the process
of his advancement. He always worked in the cornfield
till it was so dark that he could see his hoe strike
fire. When in the heat of summer he was obliged occasionally
to let his cattle breathe, he sat on a sharp stone,
lest he should rest too long. He paid half-a-dollar to
the parson for marrying him, which he always regretted,
as one of his neighbors got the job done for a pint of
mustard-seed. On fast-days he made his cattle go without
food as well as himself. He systematically stooped
to save a crooked pin or a rusty nail, as it would cost
more to make it than to pick it up. Such were his
boasts&mdash;or at least, such were the things traditionally
imputed to him.</p>

<p>He was withal a man of keen faculties; sagacious in
the purchase of land, as well as in the rotation of crops.
He was literally honest, and never cheated any one
out of a farthing, according to his arithmetic, though he
had sometimes an odd way of reckoning. It is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
that in his day the law imposed a fine of one dollar for
profane swearing. During this period, Granther Baldwin
employed a carpenter who was notoriously addicted to
this vice. Granther kept a strict account of every instance
of transgression, and when the job was done, and
the time came to settle the account, he said to the
carpenter,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You've worked with me thirty days, I think, Mr.
Kellogg?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Granther," was the reply.</p>

<p>"At a dollar a-day: that makes thirty dollars, I
think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Granther."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kellogg, I am sorry to observe that you have a
very bad habit of taking the Lord's name in vain."</p>

<p>"Yes, Granther."</p>

<p>"Well, you know that's agin the law."</p>

<p>"Yes, Granther."</p>

<p>"And there's a fine of one dollar for each offence."</p>

<p>"Yes, Granther."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;here's the account I've kept, and I find
you've broken the law twenty-five times; that is, sixteen
times in April, and nine in May. At a dollar a time,
that makes twenty-five dollars&mdash;don't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Granther."</p>

<p>"So, then, twenty-five from thirty leaves five; it appears,
therefore, that there is a balance of five dollars
due to you. How'll you take it, Mr. Kellogg? In cash,
or in my way&mdash;say in 'taters, pork, and other things?"</p>

<p>At this point the carpenter's brow lowered, but with a
prodigious effort at composure he replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Granther, you may keep the five dollars, and
I'll take it out in <em>my</em> way&mdash;that is, in swearing!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this he hurled at the old gentleman a volley of
oaths, too numerous and too profane to repeat.</p>

<p>One sketch more, and my gallery of eccentricities is
finished. Men hermits have been frequently heard of,
but a woman hermit is of rare occurrence. Nevertheless,
Ridgefield could boast of one of these among its
curiosities. Sarah Bishop was, at the period of my boyhood,
a thin, ghostly old woman, bent and wrinkled, but
still possessing a good deal of activity. She lived in a
cave, formed by nature, in a mass of projecting rocks that
overhung a deep valley or gorge in West Mountain,
about four miles from our house.</p>

<p>The rock, bare and desolate, was her home, except that
occasionally she strayed to the neighborhood villages;
seldom being absent more than one or two days at a time.
She never begged, but received such articles as were
given to her. She was of a highly religious turn of
mind, and at long intervals came to our church, and partook
of the sacrament. She sometimes visited our family&mdash;the
only one thus favored in the town&mdash;and occasionally
remained overnight. She never would eat with
us at the table, nor engage in general conversation.
Upon her early history she was invariably silent; indeed,
she spoke of her affairs with great reluctance. She
neither seemed to have sympathy for others, nor to ask it in
return. If there was any exception, it was only in respect
to the religious exercises of the family: she listened
intently to the reading of the Bible, and joined with apparent
devotion in the morning and evening prayer.</p>

<p>My excursions frequently brought me within the wild
precincts of her solitary den. Several times I have paid
a visit to the spot, and in two instances found her at
home. A place more desolate, in its general outline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
more absolutely given up to the wildness of nature, it is
impossible to conceive. Her cave was a hollow in the
rock, about six feet square. Except a few rags and an
old basin, it was without furniture; her bed being the
floor of the cave, and her pillow a projecting point of the
rock. It was entered by a natural door about three feet
wide and four feet high, and was closed in severe weather
only by pieces of bark. At a distance of a few feet was
a cleft, where she kept a supply of roots and nuts, which
she gathered, and the food that was given her. She was
reputed to have a secret depository, where she kept a
quantity of antique dresses; several of them of rich
silks, and apparently suited to fashionable life: though I
think this was an exaggeration. At a little distance
down the ledge there was a fine spring of water, near
which she was often found in fair weather.</p>

<p>There was no attempt, either in or around the spot, to
bestow upon it an air of convenience or comfort. A
small space of cleared ground was occupied by a few
thriftless peachtrees, and in summer a patch of starveling
beans, cucumbers, and potatoes. Up two or three of the
adjacent forest-trees there clambered luxuriant grape-vines,
highly productive in their season. With the exception
of these feeble marks of cultivation, all was left
ghastly and savage as nature made it. The trees, standing
upon the tops of the cliff, and exposed to the shock
of the tempest, were bent and stooping towards the
valley: their limbs contorted, and their roots clinging, as
with an agonized grasp, into the rifts of the rocks upon
which they stood. Many of them were hoary with age,
and hollow with decay; others were stripped of their leaves
by the blasts; and others still, grooved and splintered by
the lightning. The valley below, enriched with the decay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of centuries, and fed with moisture from the surrounding
hills, was a wild paradise of towering oaks, and other
giants of the vegetable kingdom, with a rank undergrowth
of tangled shrubs. In the distance, to the east,
the gathered streams spread out into a beautiful expanse
of water called Long Pond.</p>

<p>A place at once so secluded and so wild was, of course, the
chosen haunt of birds, beasts and reptiles. The eagle built
her nest and reared her young in the clefts of the rocks;
foxes found shelter in the caverns; and serpents revelled
alike in the dry hollows of the cliffs and the dark recesses
of the valley. The hermitess had made companionship
with these brute tenants of the wood. The birds had
become so familiar with her, that they seemed to heed
her almost as little as if she had been a stone. The fox
fearlessly pursued his hunt and his gambols in her
presence. The rattlesnake hushed his monitory signal as
he approached her. Such things, at least, were entertained
by the popular belief. It was said, indeed, that
she had domesticated a particular rattlesnake, and that
he paid her daily visits. She was accustomed&mdash;so said
the legend&mdash;to bring him milk from the villages, which
he devoured with great relish.</p>

<p>It will not surprise you that a subject like this should
have given rise to one of my first poetical efforts; the
first verses, in fact, that I ever published. I gave them
to Brainard, then editor of the Mirror, at Hartford; and
he inserted them, probably about the year 1823.</p>

<p>The facts in respect to this Nun of the Mountain were,
indeed, strange enough, without any embellishment of
fancy. During the winter she was confined for several
months to her cell. At that period she lived upon roots
and nuts, which she had laid in for the season. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
no fire; and, deserted even by her brute companions, she
was absolutely alone. She appeared to have no sense of
solitude, no weariness at the slow lapse of days and
months. When spring returned, she came down from
her mountain a mere shadow; each year her form more
bent, her limbs more thin and wasted, her hair more
blanched, her eye more colorless. At last, life seemed
ebbing away, like the faint light of a lamp sinking into
the socket. The final winter came; it passed, and she
was not seen in the villages around. Some of the inhabitants
went to the mountain, and found her standing
erect, her feet sunk in the frozen marsh of the valley. In
this situation, being unable to extricate herself, she had
yielded her breath to Him who gave it!</p>

<p>The early history of this strange personage was involved
in some mystery. So much as this, however, was
ascertained, that she was of good family, and lived on
Long Island. During the Revolutionary war, in one of
the numerous forays of the British soldiers, her father's
house was burned, and she was infamously treated.
Desolate in fortune, blighted at heart, she fled from
human society, and for a long time concealed her sorrows
in the cavern which she had accidentally found.
Her grief&mdash;softened by time, perhaps alleviated by a veil
of insanity&mdash;was at length so far mitigated, that, although
she did not seek human society, she could endure it.
She continued to occupy her cave till the year 1810 or
1811, when she departed in the manner I have described;
and we may hope, for a brighter and happier existence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">FAREWELL TO HOME&mdash;DANBURY&mdash;MY NEW VOCATION&mdash;MY BROTHER-IN-LAW&mdash;HIS
CONVERSATIONS WITH LAWYER HATCH&mdash;CLERICAL ANECDOTES.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the autumn of the year 1808, a sudden change took
place in my prospects. My eldest sister had married a
gentleman by the name of Cooke, in the adjacent town
of Danbury. He was a tradesman, and being in want of
a clerk, offered me the place. It was considered a desirable
situation by my parents, and, overlooking my mechanical
aptitudes, they accepted it at once, and at the
age of fifteen I found myself installed in a country store.</p>

<p>This arrangement gratified my love of change; and at
the same time, as Danbury was a much more considerable
town than Ridgefield, going to live there naturally
suggested the idea of advancement, especially as I was
to exchange my uncertain prospects for a positive profession.
However, I little comprehended what it meant to
say, "Farewell to home:" I have since learned its significance.
In thus bidding adieu to the paternal roof,
we part with youth for ever. We part with the spring-tide
of life, which strews every path with flowers, fills the
air with poetry, and the heart with rejoicing. We part
with that genial spirit which endows familiar objects&mdash;brooks,
lawns, play-grounds, hill-sides&mdash;with its own
sweet illusions; we bid adieu to this and its fairy companionships.
Even if, in after life, we return to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
scenes of our childhood, they have lost the bloom of
youth, and in its place we see the wrinkles of that age
which has graven its hard lines upon our hearts.</p>

<p>Farewell to home implies something even yet more
serious: we relinquish, and often with exultation, the
tender care of parents, in order to take upon ourselves
the responsibilities of independence. What seeming infatuation
it is, that renders us thus impatient of the
guidance of those who gave us being, and makes us at
the same time anxious to spread our untried sails upon
an untried sea, to go upon a voyage which involves all
the chances, evil as well as good, of existence! And yet
it is not infatuation&mdash;it is instinct. We cannot always
be young; we cannot all remain under the paternal roof.
The old birds push the young ones from the nest, and
force them to a trial of their wings. It is the system of
nature that impels us to go forth and try our fortunes,
and it is a kind Providence, after all, which endues us
with courage for the outset of our uncertain career.</p>

<p>I was not long in discovering that my new vocation
was very different from what I had expected, and very
different from my accustomed way of life. My habits
had been active, my employments chiefly in the open air.
I was accustomed to be frequently on horseback, and to
make excursions to the neighboring towns. I had also
enjoyed much personal liberty, which I failed not to use
in rambling over the fields and forests. All this was
now changed. My duties lay exclusively in the store,
and this seemed now my prison. From morning to
night I remained there, and, as our business was not
large, I had many hours upon my hands with nothing to
do but to consider the weariness of my situation. My
brother-in-law was always present, and being a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
severe aspect and watchful eyes, I felt a sort of restraint,
which, for a time, was agonizing. I had, consequently,
pretty sharp attacks of homesickness; a disease which,
though not dangerous, is one of the most distressing to
which suffering humanity is exposed.</p>

<p>This state of misery continued for some weeks, during
which time I revolved various plans of escape from my
confinement: such as stealing away at night, making my
way to Norwalk, getting on board a sloop, and going as
cabin-boy to the West Indies. I believe that a small
impulse would have set me upon some such mad expedition.
By degrees, however, I became habituated to my
occupation, and as my situation was eligible in other respects,
I found myself ere long reconciled to it.</p>

<p>The father and mother of my brother-in-law were aged
people, living with him in the same house, and as one
family. They were persons of great amiability and excellence
of character: the former, Colonel Cooke, was
eighty years of age, but he had still the perfect exercise
of his faculties, and though he had ceased all business,
he was cheerful, and took a lively interest in passing
events. Never have I seen a more pleasing spectacle
than this reverend couple, at the age of fourscore, both
smoking their pipes in the evening, with two generations
of their descendants around them.</p>

<p>My brother-in-law was a man of decided character,
and his portrait deserves a place in these annals. He
had graduated at Yale College, and had been qualified
for the bar; but his health was feeble, and therefore,
chiefly for occupation, he succeeded to the store which
his father had kept before him. Being in easy circumstances,
he made no great efforts in business. Though,
as I have said, he was of stern aspect, and his manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
were somewhat cold and distant, his character was that
of a just and kind man. In business he treated people
respectfully, but he never solicited custom: he showed,
but never recommended his goods. If his advice were
asked, he offered it without regard to his own interest.
He gave me no instructions, but left me to the influence
of his example. He was of a religious turn of mind, not
merely performing the accustomed duties of a Christian,
but making devotional books a large part of his study.
Perhaps he was conscious of failing health, and already
heard the monitory voice of that disease which was ere
long to terminate his career.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was not insensible to the pleasures of
cultivated society, and however grave he might be in his
general air and manner, he was particularly gratified with
the visits of a man, in all things his opposite, Moses
Hatch, then a leading lawyer in Danbury.</p>

<p>This person was a frequent visitor to the store, and the
long winter which commenced soon after I entered upon
my apprenticeship was not a little enlivened by his conversations
with my master. It frequently happened during
the deep snows, that the day passed without a single
customer, and on these occasions Lawyer Hatch was
pretty sure to pay us a visit. It was curious to see these
two men, so opposite in character, attracted to each other
as if by contradiction. My brother-in-law evidently
found a pleasant relaxation in the conversation of his
neighbor, embellished with elegant wit and varied learning,
while the latter derived equal gratification from the
serious, manly intellect of his friend. In general the
former was the talker, and the latter the listener; yet
sometimes the conversation became discussion, and a
keen trial of wit <i>versus</i> logic ensued. The lawyer always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
contended for victory; my brother-in-law for the
truth.</p>

<p>The precise form of these conversations has vanished
from my mind, but some of the topics remain. I recollect
long talks about the embargo, non-intercourse, and
other Jeffersonian measures, which were treated with unsparing
ridicule and reproach; anecdotes and incidents
of Napoleon, who excited mingled admiration and terror;
with observations upon public men, as well in Europe as
America. I remember also a very keen discussion upon
Berkeley's theory of the ideality of nature, mental and
material, which so far excited my curiosity, that, finding
the "Minute Philosopher" by that author, in the family
library, I read it through with great interest and attention.
The frequent references to Shakespeare in these
conversations led me to look into his works, and, incited
by the recommendations of my sister, I read them
through, somewhat doggedly, seeking even to penetrate
the more difficult and obscure passages.</p>

<p>It frequently happened that my master, owing to the
influence of disease, was affected with depression of
spirits; and the lawyer's best wit and choicest stories
were expended without even exciting a smile. Not discouraged,
but rather stimulated by such adversity, he
usually went on, and was pretty sure at last to strike the
vein, as Moses did the water in the rock, and a gush of
uncontrollable laughter was the result. I remember in
one instance, Mr. Cooke sat for a long time, looking
moodily into the fire, while Squire Hatch went on telling
stories, chiefly about clergymen, of which he had a great
assortment. I will endeavor to give you a sketch of the
scene.</p>

<p>"I know not why it is so," said the lawyer; "but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
fact is undeniable, that the most amusing anecdotes are
about clergymen. The reason perhaps is, that incongruity
is the source of humorous associations; and this is evidently
the most frequent and striking in a profession
which sets apart its members as above the mass of mankind,
in a certain gravity of character and demeanor, of
which the black coat is the emblem. A spot upon this
strikes every eye, while a brown coat, being the color of
dirt, hides rather than reveals what is upon its surface.
Thus it is, as we all know, that what would be insipid as
coming from a layman, is very laughable if it happens to
a parson. I have heard that on a certain occasion, as
the Rev. J&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; was about to read a hymn, he
saw a little boy sitting behind the chorister in the gallery,
who had intensely red hair. The day was cold, and the
little rogue was pretending to warm his hands by holding
them close to the chorister's head. This so disconcerted
the minister, that it was some minutes before he could go
on with the services."</p>

<p>The only effect of this was, that my master drew down
one corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>"I have heard of another clergyman," said the lawyer,
"who suffered in a similar way. One day, in the very
midst of his sermon, he saw Deacon B&mdash;&mdash; fast asleep,
his head leaning back on the rail of the pew, and his
mouth wide open. A young fellow in the gallery above,
directly over him, took a quid of tobacco from his mouth,
and taking a careful aim, let it drop plump into the deacon's
mouth. The latter started from his sleep, and went
through a terrible paroxysm of fright and choking before
he recovered."</p>

<p>Mr. Cooke bit his lip, but was silent. Lawyer Hatch,
although he pretended to be all the while looking into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the fire, got a quick side-glance at the face of his auditor,
and continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know the Rev. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;, sir? Well, one day
he told me, that as he was on his way to New Haven he
came to the house of one of his former parishioners, who,
some years before, had removed to that place. As he
was about to pass it, he remembered that this person had
died recently, and he thought it meet and proper to stop
and condole with the widow. She met him very cheerfully,
and they had some pleasant chat together.</p>

<p>"'Madam,' said he, after a time, 'it is a painful subject&mdash;but
you have recently met with a severe loss.'</p>

<p>"She instantly applied her apron to her eyes, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Oh yes, doctor; there's no telling how I feel.'</p>

<p>"'It is indeed a great bereavement you have suffered.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, doctor; very great, indeed.'</p>

<p>"'I hope you bear it with submission?'</p>

<p>"'I try tu; but oh, doctor, I sometimes feel in my
heart&mdash;Goosy, goosy gander, where shall I wander?'"</p>

<p>The lawyer glanced at the object of his attack, and
seeming to see a small breach in the wall, he thought it
time to bring up his heavy guns. He went on,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's another story about this same Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;,
which is amusing. Some years ago he lost his wife, and
after a time he began to look out for another. At last
he fixed his mind upon a respectable lady in a neighboring
town, and commenced paying her his addresses.
This naturally absorbed much of his time and attention,
and his parish became dissatisfied. The deacons of the
church held several conferences on the subject, and it
was finally agreed that Deacon Becket, who had the
grace of smooth speech, should give the Reverend Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
a hint of what they deemed his fearful backsliding. Accordingly,
the next Sabbath morning, on going to church,
the deacon overtook the parson, and the following dialogue
ensued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Good morning, Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p>"'Good morning, Deacon Becket.'</p>

<p>"'Well, Doctor, I'm glad to meet you; for I wanted
to say to you as how I thought of changing my pew!'</p>

<p>"'Indeed! And why so?'</p>

<p>"'Well, I'll tell you. I sit, as you know, clear over
the backside of the meeting-house; and between me and
the pulpit there's Judy Vickar, Molly Warren, Experience
Pettibone, and half-a-dozen old maids, who sit with
their mouths wide open, and they catch all the best of your
sarmon; and when it gets to me, it's plaguy poor stuff!'"</p>

<p>My brother-in-law could hold out no longer: his face
was agitated for a moment with nervous spasms; and
then, bending forward, he burst into a round, hearty
laugh. The lawyer&mdash;who made it a point never to
smile at his own jokes&mdash;still had a look upon his face
as much as to say, "Well, sir, I thought I should get my
case."</p>

<p>It may be easily imagined that I was greatly interested
by these conversations and discussions; and always felt
not a little annoyed, if perchance, as sometimes happened,
I was called away in the midst of a good story,
or a keen debate, to supply a customer with a gallon of
treacle, or a paper of pins. I know not if this disgusted
me with my trade; but it is very certain that I conceived
for it a great dislike, nearly from the beginning.
Never, so far as I can recollect, did I for one moment
enter heartily into its spirit. I was always, while I continued
in it, a mere servile laborer; doing my duty, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
yet with a languid and reluctant heart. However,
I got through the winter; and when the summer came,
Mr. Cooke nearly gave up personal attention to business
in consequence of ill health; and we had a new clerk,
who was older than myself, and took the responsible
charge of the establishment. He was an excellent merchant,
and to me was a kind and indulgent friend. He
afterwards settled in Troy, where he is still living, in the
enjoyment of an ample fortune, and in excellent reputation
as a father, friend, Christian, and neighbor; the
natural fruit of good sense, good temper, and good conduct.</p>

<p class="hang">NEW HAVEN&mdash;DISTINGUISHED MEN&mdash;WHITNEY'S COTTON-GIN&mdash;DURHAM&mdash;MY
GRANDMOTHER'S INDIAN PUDDINGS&mdash;IN SEARCH OF A DOCTOR&mdash;RETURN
TO DANBURY&mdash;THE COLD FRIDAY&mdash;FACTORY WORKMEN&mdash;MATHEMATICS.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the summer of 1809 I made a short tour with my
brother-in-law and my sister, for the health of the former.
This, to me, was a grand expedition; for among other
places we visited was New Haven, then a sort of Jerusalem
in my imagination; a holy place containing Yale
College, of which Dr. Dwight was president. Besides
all this, one of my uncles and some of my cousins lived
there; and, better still, my brother was there, and then
a member of the college. Ah, how my heart beat when
we set out! Such was the vividness of my perceptions,
that I could fill a book with recollections of that short,
simple journey; the whole circuit not exceeding one
hundred and twenty miles.</p>

<p>I was duly impressed with the beauty of New Haven;
for then, as now, it was celebrated for a rare union of
rural freshness and city elegance. I have recently, in
passing through it, had a transient view of its appearance;
and may safely affirm that, after pretty large observation
in the Old World as well as in the New, I
know of no town or city more inviting; especially to
one whose judgment is cultivated by observation and
study, and whose feelings are chastened by reflection and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
experience. There is something of the activity and
bustle of commerce in a part of the town, and at one
point, all the spasm of a railway station. In other portions
of the place, and over three-fourths of its area,
there is the quietude and repose proper to a seat of learning.
Here the houses seem suited to the city, each with
a garden breathing the perfumes of the country.</p>

<p>At the period of the visit I am describing, New
Haven had not one-half its present population; and many
of the institutions which now adorn it did not exist. The
College, however, was then as now, a leading literary institution
in the country. To me it was an object of special
reverence, as my grandfather and his five sons had all
graduated there. My brother and two of my cousins
were at this time among its inmates. Of course, I looked
with intense curiosity at the several buildings that belonged
to it. Many things here excited my admiration.
I looked with particular interest&mdash;I may add, with some
degree of envy&mdash;at the students, who seemed to me the
privileged sons of the earth. Several were pointed out
as promising to be the master-spirits of their age and
generation; in some cases, I have since seen these anticipations
fulfilled.</p>

<p>Next to the College I visited the Bay, and for the first
time actually stood upon the shore of that living sea
which, through my whole childhood, had spread its blue
bosom before me in the distant horizon. A party of
three or four of us took a boat, and went down toward
the entrance of the Bay, landing on the eastern side.
From this point the view was enchanting; it was a soft
summer afternoon, and the sea only breathed upon by
light puffs of wind that came from the west. I looked
long, and with a species of entrancement, at its heaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and swelling surface: I ran my eye far away, till it met
the line where sky and wave are blended together: I followed
the lulling surf as it broke, curling and winding,
among the mimic bays of the rocky shore. It was a
spectacle, not only full of beauty in itself, but to me it
was a revelation and a fulfilment of the thousand half-formed
fancies which had been struggling in my longing
bosom from very childhood.</p>

<p><a name="sea" id="sea">&nbsp;</a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/i_124.jpg" width="376" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">FIRST ADVENTURE ON THE SEA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Our party was so occupied with our contemplations,
that we had scarcely noticed a thunder-storm, which now
approached and menaced us from the west. We set out
to return, but before we had got half across the Bay it
broke full upon us. The change in the aspect of the sea
was fearful: all its gentleness was gone; and now, black
and scowling, it seemed as if agitated by a demon,
threatening everything with destruction that came within
its scope. By a severe struggle we succeeded in reaching
Long Walk, though not without risk.</p>

<p>While staying at New Haven, I met many distinguished
men; as the house of my uncle, Elizur Goodrich, was
frequented by all the celebrities of the place. Among
these was Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton-gin, a
machine for combing out the seeds from the cotton in its
raw state, to which America may almost be said to owe
her cotton trade. Whitney's first gin was made in 1793,
at which time almost the whole of our raw material was
imported. The results of his invention may be estimated
by the fact, that while in 1789 only one million pounds
of cotton were produced in the United States, the product
of the year 1855 exceeded fourteen hundred millions!</p>

<p>We saw the original model of Mr. Whitney's gin at
his gun-factory, which was situated in a wild, romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
spot, near the foot of East Rock, and about two miles
distant from New Haven.</p>

<p>Having spent about a week at New Haven, we proceeded
to Durham, an old-fashioned, sleepy town, of a
thousand inhabitants. It is chiefly remarkable for the
distinguished men it has produced&mdash;the Chaunceys, celebrated
in the annals of New England, and, I may add, in
those of the country at large; the Wadsworths, no less
noted in various commanding stations, military and civil,
public and private; the Lymans, renowned in the battlefield,
the college, the pulpit, and the senate; the Austins&mdash;father
and son&mdash;to whose talent and enterprise Texas
owes her position as a member of the Union.</p>

<p>To this list of remarkable names, I trust I may add
that of the Goodriches, without the imputation of egotism,
for historical justice demands it. At the time I visited
the place, nearly all the family had long since left it.
My grandfather, Dr. Goodrich, died in 1797, but my
grandmother was living, as well as her daughter, Mrs.
Smith, wife of Rev. David Smith, the clergyman of the
place, who had succeeded to my grandfather's pulpit.</p>

<p>I trust I have all due respect for my paternal grandmother,
who has already, by the way, been introduced to
your notice. She was now quite lame, but active,
energetic, and alive to everything that was passing. She
welcomed me heartily, and took the best care of me in
the world, lavishing upon me, without stint, all the
treasures of her abundant larder. As to her Indian
puddings&mdash;alas, I shall never see their like again! A
comfortable old body she was in all things, and, as I have
before remarked, took a special interest in the welfare of
the generation of descendants rising up around her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
When she saw me eating with a good appetite, her
benignant grandmotherly face beamed like a lantern.</p>

<p>As to my uncle and aunt Smith, I may remark that
they were plain, pious people, the former worthily filling
the pulpit of my grandfather, and enjoying a high degree
of respect, alike from his position and character. Besides
attending to his parochial duties, he prepared young men
for college. Among his pupils were several persons who
attained distinction. As a man, he was distinguished for
his cheerful, frank, friendly manners: as a preacher, he
was practical, sincere, and successful. I must mention a
story of him, among my pulpit anecdotes. As sometimes
happens, in a congregation of farmers during midsummer,
it once chanced that a large number of his people,
even the deacons in the sacramental seat, fell asleep
in the very midst of the sermon. The minister looked
around, and just at this moment, the only person who
seemed quite awake was his eldest son, David, sitting in
the pew by the side of the pulpit. Pausing a moment,
and looking down upon his son, he exclaimed, in a
powerful voice:</p>

<p>"David, wake up!"</p>

<p>In a moment the whole congregation roused themselves,
and long did they remember the rebuke.</p>

<p>During our stay at Durham, my brother-in-law was so
ill as to need the advice of a skilful physician. Accordingly,
I was dispatched on horseback to Middletown, a
distance of eight or ten miles, for Dr. O&mdash;&mdash;, then
famous in all the country round about. On my way I
met a man of weather-beaten complexion and threadbare
garments, mounted on a lean and jaded mare. Beneath
him was a pair of plump saddlebags. He had all the
marks of a doctor, for then men of his profession traversed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the country on horseback, carrying with them a collection
of pills, powders, and elixirs, equivalent to an apothecary's
shop. Instinct told me that he was my man. As
I was about to pass him I drew in my breath, to ask if
he were Dr. O&mdash;&mdash;, but a sudden bashfulness seized me:
the propitious moment passed, and I went on.</p>

<p>On arriving at the house of Dr. O&mdash;&mdash;, I learned that
he had gone to the village in the south-western part of
the town, six or eight miles off. "There!" said I to
myself, "I knew it was he: if I had only spoken to
him!" However, reflection was vain. I followed to the
designated spot, and there I found that he had left about
half an hour before, for another village in the central
part of the town. I gave chase, but he was too quick
for me, so that I was obliged to return to Durham without
him. "Ah!" I thought, "how much trouble a little
courage would have saved me!" In fact, I took the
incident to heart, and have often practised to advantage
upon the lesson it suggested; which is, Never to let a
doctor, or anything else, slip, for the want of asking an
opportune question.</p>

<p>At length we departed from Durham, and took our
way homeward, through a series of small towns, arriving
at last at Woodbury. The week of our sojourn here flew
on golden wings with me. The village itself was after
my own heart. It lies in a small tranquil valley, its
western boundary consisting of a succession of gentle
acclivities, covered with forests; that on the east is
formed of basaltic ledges, broken into wild and picturesque
forms, rising sharp and hard against the horizon.
Through the valley, in long serpentine sweeps, flows a
stream, clear and bright, now dashing and now sauntering;
here presenting a rapid, and there a glassy pool.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
In ancient times it was bordered by cities of the beaver;
it was now the haunt of a few isolated and persecuted
muskrats. In the spring and autumn, the wild ducks, in
their migrations, often stooped to its bosom for a night's
lodging. At all seasons it was renowned for its trout.
In former ages, when the rivers, protected by the deep
forests, ran full to the brim, and when the larger streams
were filled to repletion with shad and salmon, this was
sometimes visited by enterprising individuals of their
race, which shot up cataracts, and leaped over obstructing
rocks, roots, and mounds, impelled by instinct to seek
places remote from the sea, where they might deposit
their spawn in safety. In those days, I imagine, the
accidents and incidents of shad and salmon life often
rivalled the adventurous annals of Marco Polo or Robinson
Crusoe.</p>

<p>There was about this little village a singular union of
refinement and rusticity, of cultivated plain and steepling
rock, of blooming meadow and dusky forest. The long,
wide street, saving the highway and a few stray paths here
and there, was a bright, grassy lawn, decorated with abundance
of sugar-maples, which appeared to have found their
Paradise. Such is the shape of the encircling hills and
ledges that the site of the village seemed a sort of
secluded Happy Valley, where everything turns to poetry
and romance. And this aptitude is abundantly encouraged
by history; for here was once the favored home of
a tribe of Indians. All around&mdash;the rivers, the hills, the
forests&mdash;are still rife with legends and remembrances of
the olden time. A rocky mound, rising above the river
on one side, and dark forests on the other, bears the
name of "Pomperaug's Castle;" a little to the north,
near a bridle-path that traversed the meadows, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
heap of stones, called "Pomperaug's Grave." To the
east I found a wild ledge, called "Bethel Rock." And
each of these objects has its story.</p>

<p>It was a great time, that happy week&mdash;for let it be remembered
that for a whole year I had been imprisoned
in a country store. What melody was there in the forest
echoes then! Ah! I have since heard Catalani, and
Garcia, and Pasta, and Sontag, and Grisi; I have even
heard "the Swedish Nightingale;" nay, in France and
Italy&mdash;the very home of music and song&mdash;I have listened
to the true nightingale, which has given to Jenny Lind
her sweetest and most appropriate epithet; but never, in
one or all, have I heard such music as filled my ears that
incense-breathing morn, when I made a foray into the
wilds of Woodbury!</p>

<p>We returned to Danbury after a tour of some five or
six weeks. The succeeding autumn and winter presented
no peculiar incident&mdash;with a single exception. There
was, if I rightly remember, in the month of February, a
certain "cold Friday," which passed down to succeeding
generations as among the marvels of the time. It had
snowed heavily for three days, and the ground was
covered three feet deep. A driving wind from the north-east
then set in, and growing colder and colder, it became
at last so severe as to force everybody to shelter.
This continued for two days, the whole air being filled
with sleet, so that the sun, without a cloud in the sky,
shone dim and grey as through a fog. The third day
the wind increased, both in force and intensity of cold.
Horses, cattle, fowls, sheep, perished in their coverings.
The roads were blocked up with enormous drifts; the
mails were stopped, travelling was suspended; the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
indeed, seemed paralyzed, and the circulation of life to
be arrested.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE COLD FRIDAY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the morning of this third day, which was the
ominous and famous Friday, word was brought to my
sister that a poor family, about two miles off, to whom
she had long been a kind friend, was in danger of starvation.
She knew no fear, and tolerated no weakness. A
thing that ought to be done, was to be done. Therefore,
a sack was filled with bread, meat, candles, and a pint
of rum: this was lashed around my waist. The horse
was brought to the door&mdash;I mounted and set off. I
knew the animal well, and we had enjoyed many a
scamper together. He was, indeed, after my own heart&mdash;clean
limbed, with full, knowing eyes, and small, pointed
sensitive ears. He had a cheerful walk, a fleet, skimming
trot, a swift gallop, and all these paces we had often
tried. I think he knew who was on his back; but when
we got to the turning of the road, which brought his
nostrils into the very tunnel of the gale, he snorted,
whirled backward, and seemed resolved to return. I,
however, brought him steady to his work, gave him
sharp advice in the ribs, and showed him that I was resolved
to be master. Hesitating a moment, as if in
doubt whether I could be in earnest, he started forward;
yet so keen was the blast, that he turned aside his head,
and screamed as if his nostrils were pierced with hot
iron. On he went, however, in some instances up to the
saddle in the drift, yet clearing it at full bounds.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we were at the door of the miserable
hut, now half buried in a snow-drift. I was just in time.
The wretched inmates&mdash;a mother and three small children&mdash;without
fire, without food, without help or hope,
were in bed, poorly clothed, and only keeping life in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
their bodies by a mutual cherishing of warmth, like pigs
or puppies in a similar extremity. The scene within was
dismal in the extreme. The fireplace was choked with
snow, which had fallen down the chimney: the ill-adjusted
doors and windows admitted alike the drift and
the blast, both of which swept across the room in cutting
currents. As I entered, the pale, haggard mother comprehend
at a glance that relief had come, burst into a
flood of tears. I had no time for words. I threw them
the sack, remounted my horse, and, the wind at my back,
I flew home. One of my ears was a little frost-bitten,
and occasionally, for years after, a tingling and itching
sensation there reminded me of my ride; which, after
all, left an agreeable remembrance upon my mind.</p>

<p>Danbury is a handsome town, chiefly built on a long,
wide street, crossed near the northern extremity by a
small river, a branch of the Housatonic, which, having
numerous rapids, affords abundance of mill-sites in its
course. At this crossing there were two extensive hat-factories,
famous over the whole country.</p>

<p>Nearly all the workmen in these establishments, of
whom there were several hundred at the time I am describing,
were foreigners, mostly English and Irish. A
large part of the business of our store was the furnishing
of rum to these poor wretches, who bought one or two
quarts on Saturday night and drank till Monday, and
frequently till Tuesday. A factory workman of those
days was thought to be born to toil, and to get drunk.
Philanthropy itself had not then lifted its eye or its
hopes above this hideous malaria of custom. It is a
modern discovery that manufacturing towns may rise up,
where comfort, education, morals, and religion, in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
best and happiest exercise, may be possessed by the toiling
masses.</p>

<p>A few words more, and I have done with Danbury.
The health of my brother-in-law gradually failed, and at
last, as winter approached, he took to his room, and
finally to his bed. By almost insensible degrees, and
with singular tranquillity of mind and body, he approached
his end. It was a trait of his character to believe
nothing, to do nothing, by halves. Having founded his
faith on Christ, Christianity was now, in its duties, its
promises, and its anticipations, as real as life itself. He
was afflicted with no doubts, no fears. With his mind in
full vigor, his strong intellect vividly awake, he was
ready to enter into the presence of his God. The hour
came. He had taken leave of his friends, and then, feeling
a sense of repose, he asked to be left alone. They
all departed save one, who sat apart, listening to every
breath. In a few moments she came and found him
asleep, but it was the sleep that knows no waking!</p>

<p>I continued in the store alone for several months, selling
out the goods, and closing up the affairs of the estate.
I had now a good deal of time to myself, and thumbed
over several books, completing my reading of Shakspeare,
to which I have already alluded. It happened
that we had a neighbor over the way, a good-natured,
chatty old gentleman, by the name of Ebenezer White.
He had been a teacher, and had a great taste for mathematics.
In those days it was the custom for the newspapers
to publish mathematical questions, and to invite
their solution. Master White was sure to give the answer
first. In fact, his genius for mathematics was so
large, that it left rather a moderate space in his brain for
common sense. He was, however, full of good feeling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and was now entirely at leisure. Indeed, time hung
heavy on his hands, so he made me frequent visits, and
in fact lounged away an hour or two of almost every
day at the store. I became at last interested in mathematics,
and under his good-natured and gratuitous lessons
I learned something of geometry and trigonometry, and
thus passed on to surveying and navigation. This was
the first drop of real science that I ever tasted&mdash;I might
almost say the last, for though I have since skimmed a
good many books, I feel that I have really mastered
almost nothing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">ARRIVAL AT HARTFORD&mdash;MY OCCUPATION THERE&mdash;RESTLESSNESS&mdash;MY
FRIEND GEORGE SHELDON.</p></blockquote>


<p>I now enter upon a new era in my life. Early in the
summer of 1811, I took leave of Danbury, and went to
Hartford. On my arrival there, I was installed in the
dry-goods store of C. B. K&mdash;&mdash;, my father having made
the arrangement some weeks before.</p>

<p>My master had no aptitude for business, and spent
much of his time away, leaving the affairs of the shop to
an old clerk, by the name of Jones, and to me. Things
went rather badly, and he sought to mend his fortune by
speculation in Merino sheep&mdash;then the rage of the day.
A ram sold for a thousand dollars, and a ewe for a hundred.
Fortunes were made and lost in a day during this
mania. My master, after buying a flock and driving it to
Vermont, where he spent three months, came back pretty
well shorn&mdash;that is, three thousand dollars out of pocket!
This soon brought his affairs to a crisis, and so in the
autumn I was transferred to the dry-goods store of J. B.
H&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>My new employer had neither wife nor child to take
up his time, so he devoted himself sedulously to business.
He was, indeed, made for it&mdash;elastic in his frame, quick-minded,
of even temper, and assiduous politeness. He
was already well established, and things marched along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
as if by rail. For a time we had another clerk, but he
was soon dismissed, and I was the only assistant; my
master, however, seldom leaving the shop during business
hours. Had the capacity for trade been in me, I might
now have learned my business. I think I may say that
I fulfilled my duty, at least in form. I was regular in my
hours, kept the books duly journalized and posted. I
never consciously wronged arithmetic to the amount of
a farthing. I duly performed my task at the counter.
Yet, in all this I was a slave: my heart was not in my
work. My mind was away; I dreamed of other things;
I thought of other pursuits.</p>

<p>And yet I scarcely knew all this. I had certainly no
definite plan for the future. A thousand things floated
before my imagination. Every book I read drew me
aside into its own vortex. Poetry made me poetical;
politics made me political; travels made me truant. I
was restless, for I was in a wrong position; yet I asked
no advice, for I did not know that I needed it. My head
and heart were a hive of thoughts and feelings, without
the regulating and sedative supremacy of a clear and
controlling intelligence.</p>

<p>I was then eighteen years of age. I had been sufficiently
educated for my station. My parents had now
removed from Ridgefield to Berlin, a distance of but
eleven miles from my present residence, so that I had
easy and frequent communication with them. My uncle,
Chauncey Goodrich, then a Senator of the United States,
lived in an almost contiguous street, and while in the
city, always treated me with the kindness and consideration
which my relationship to him naturally dictated. In
general, then, my situation was eligible enough; and yet
I was unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The truth is, I had now been able to sit in judgment
upon myself&mdash;to review my acquirements, to analyze my
capacities, to estimate my character, to compare myself
with others, and to see a little into the future. The
decision was painful to my ambition. I had all along,
unconsciously, cherished a vague idea of some sort of
eminence, and this, unhappily, had nothing to do with
selling goods or making money. I had lived in the
midst of relations, friends, and alliances, all of which had
cultivated in me trains of thought alien to my present
employment. My connections were respectable&mdash;some
of them eminent, but none of them rich. All had acquired
their positions without wealth, and I think it was
rather their habit to speak of it as a very secondary
affair. Brought up under such influences, how could I
give up my heart to trade? It was clear, indeed, that I
had missed my vocation.</p>

<p>Full of this conviction, I besought my parents to allow
me to quit the store, and attempt to make my way
through college. Whether for good or ill, I know not,
but they decided against the change, and certainly on
substantial grounds. Their circumstances did not permit
them to offer me any considerable aid, and without it they
feared that I should meet with insuperable difficulties. I
returned to the store disheartened at first, but after a
time my courage revived, and I resolved to re-educate
myself. I borrowed some Latin books, and with the aid
of George Sheldon, an assistant in a publisher's establishment,
and at this time my bosom friend, I passed
through the Latin Grammar, and penetrated a little way
into Virgil. This was done at night, for during the day
I was fully occupied.</p>

<p>At the same time I began, with such light and strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
as I possessed, to train my mind, to discipline my
thoughts, then as untamed as the birds of the wilderness.
<em>I sought to think</em>&mdash;to think steadily, to acquire the
power of forcing my understanding up to a point, and
make it stand there and do its work. I attempted to
gain the habit of speaking methodically, logically, and
with accumulating power, directed to a particular object.
I did all this as well by study as by practice. I read
Locke on the Understanding and Watts on the Mind. I
attempted composition, and aided myself by Blair's
Rhetoric.</p>

<p>This was a task; for not only was my time chiefly occupied
by my daily duties, but it was a contest against
habit&mdash;it was myself against myself; and in this I was
almost unaided and alone. I was to lay aside the slipshod
practice of satisfying myself with impressions, feelings,
guesses; in short, of dodging mental labor by
jumping at conclusions. I was, indeed, to learn the
greatest of all arts, that of reasoning&mdash;of discovering the
truth; and I was to do this alone, and in the face of difficulties,
partly founded in my mental constitution, and
partly also in my training.</p>

<p>I did not at first comprehend the extent of my undertaking.
By degrees I began to appreciate it: I saw and
felt, at last, that it was an enormous task, and even after
I had resolved upon it, again and again my courage gave
way, and I ceased my efforts in despair. Still I returned
to the work by spasms. I found, for instance, that my
geography was all wrong: Asia stood up edgewise in my
imagination, just as I had seen it on an old smoky map
in Lieutenant Smith's study; Africa was in the south-east
corner of creation, and Europe was somewhere in the
north-east. In fact, my map of the world was very Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
in its projection. I knew better, but still I had thus
conceived it, and the obstinate bump of locality insisted
upon presenting its outlines to my mind according to
this arrangement. I had similar jumbles of conception
and habit as to other things. This would not do; so I
re-learned the elements of geography; I revised my history,
my chronology, my natural history, in all of which
I had caught casual glimpses of knowledge. What I
read I read earnestly. I determined to pass no word
without ascertaining its meaning, and I persevered in
this, doggedly, for five-and-twenty years.</p>

<p>My friend Sheldon was of inestimable service to me in
my studies. Possessing advantages over me in age, experience,
and education, he made many rough places
smooth to my stumbling feet. Especially when, during
my early efforts in thinking, my mind was assailed with
doubts as to the truth of the Christian religion, his clear
intelligence and sincere faith did much to help me
through my difficulties.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">WAR WITH ENGLAND&mdash;IN THE ARMY&mdash;MY UNCLE'S ADVICE&mdash;CAMPAIGNING&mdash;ON
THE MARCH&mdash;OUR MILITARY COSTUME&mdash;MY FIRST SOLDIER'S SUPPER.</p></blockquote>


<p>During my residence at Hartford war was declared
against Great Britain. For some time Connecticut held
aloof from all participation in the struggle. But when,
in 1813, our own territory was threatened, all feeling
vanished before the instinct of self-preservation, and the
strong feeling of animosity which then raged against
England. Anticipating this state of things, the state
government had made preparations for the emergency.</p>

<p>As it was midsummer&mdash;a period when the husbandmen
could ill afford to leave their farms&mdash;orders were sent by
Governor Smith to dispatch at once the companies of
militia from the larger towns to the defence of New London
and the neighboring country. At that time I belonged
to an artillery company, and this was among those
ordered to the coast. I received a summons at four
o'clock in the afternoon to be ready to march next day
at sunrise. I went at once to consult my uncle&mdash;who,
by the way, was at that time not only mayor of the
city, but Lieutenant-Governor of the State. He had a
short time before promised to make me one of his aids,
and perhaps thought I should expect him now to fulfill
his engagement. He soon set that matter at rest.</p>

<p>"You must, of course, go," said he. "We old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
federalists cannot shelter our nephews when there is a
question of defending our own territory."</p>

<p>"Ought I not to consult my parents?" said I.</p>

<p>"I will go down and see them to-morrow," he replied.</p>

<p>"Certainly, then, I shall go. I wish to go. My only
feeling is, that my mother may have some anxiety."</p>

<p>"I will see her to-morrow. You may be at ease on
that subject. Be ready to march at sunrise, according
to your orders. I will come and see you before you
start."</p>

<p>The next morning, while it was yet dark, he came, gave
me some letters of introduction, and also supplied me
with ten dollars&mdash;a welcome addition to my light purse.
After a little advice he said,&mdash;"I have only one thing to
add: If you come to a fight, <em>don't run away till the rest
do</em>. Goodby!"</p>

<p>The next morning, June 7, 1813, about sunrise, the
whole company, nearly sixty in number, mounted in
wagons, departed. At sunset we were on the heights
two miles back of New London. No provision had been
made for us, and so we went supperless to bed in a large
empty barn. I scarcely closed my eyes, partly because
it was my first experiment in sleeping on the floor, and
partly because of the terrific snoring of a fellow-soldier
by my side. Never have I heard such a succession of
choking, suffocating, strangling sounds, as issued from
his throat. I expected that he would die, and, indeed,
once or twice I thought he was dead. Strange to say,
he got up the next morning in excellent condition, and
seemed, indeed, to feel better for the exercise. This man
became quite a character before the campaign was over:
he got the title, of Æolus, and as he could not be tolerated
in the barracks, he was provided with a tent at a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
distance, where he blew his blast without restraint. At
the close of the campaign he was the fattest man in the
company.</p>

<p>I was glad to see the daylight. The weather was fine,
and as the sun came up we saw the British fleet&mdash;some
half-dozen large ships of war&mdash;lying off the mouth of
the Thames. They seemed very near at hand, and for
the first time I realized my situation&mdash;that of a soldier
who was likely soon to be engaged in battle. I said
nothing of my emotions: indeed, words were unnecessary.
I watched the countenances of my companions as
they first caught a view of the black and portentous
squadron, and I read in almost every face a reflection of
my own feelings. We were, however, not all sentimentalists.
There were among us, as doubtless in all such
companies, a supply of witty, reckless Gallios, who gave
a cheerful turn to our thoughts. We soon dispersed
among the inhabitants, scattered over the neighboring
hills and valleys, for breakfast. Like hungry wolves we
fell upon the lean larders, and left famine behind. Of
course every one offered to pay, but not one person
would accept a farthing: we were, indeed, received as
protectors and deliverers. It was something, after all, to
be soldiers! With our stomachs fortified, and our consciousness
flattered, we came cheerfully together.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock we were mustered, and began our march
all in our best trim: cocked hats, long-tailed blue coats,
with red facings, white pantaloons, and shining cutlasses
at our sides. Our glittering cannon moved along with
the solemnity of elephants. It was, in fact, a fine company&mdash;all
young men, and many from the best families
in Hartford. As we entered New London the streets
presented some confusion, for the people were still removing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
back into the country, as an attack was daily expected.
A few military companies were also gathering
into the town. We were, however, not wholly overlooked:
women put their heads out of the windows and
smiled their gratitude as we passed along. Men stopped
and surveyed us with evident signs of approbation. It
was a glorious thing to belong to such a company! At
last we came to a halt in one of the public squares.
Then there was racing and chasing of aids-de-camp for
four mortal hours, during which our martial pride drooped
a little in the broiling sun. At four o'clock in the
afternoon we were transported across the Thames to the
village of Groton, and took up our quarters in a large
house on the bank of the river, vacated for our use.
Two immense kettles&mdash;the one filled with junks of salt
beef, and the other with unwashed potatoes&mdash;were swung
upon the kitchen trammels, and at six o'clock in the
evening we were permitted each to fish out his dinner
from the seething mass. That was my first soldier's supper;
and, after all, it was a welcome meal.</p>

CANNON-BALLS&mdash;OUT OF HARM'S WAY&mdash;AN ALARM&mdash;ON GUARD&mdash;TAKE A
PRISONER&mdash;STRANGE EMOTIONS&mdash;MY LEFT-HAND CHUM&mdash;A GRATEFUL
COUNTRY.</p></blockquote>


<p>New London is situated on the western bank of the
river Thames, three miles from its mouth. It has now
ten or twelve thousand inhabitants, but at the time I am
speaking of there were not more than four thousand.
The entrance to the river is broad, and affords a fine harbor.
This is defended by Fort Trumbull on the western
side of the river, half a mile below the city. It contained
a garrison of six or seven hundred soldiers during the
war of 1812.</p>

<p>Opposite to New London is the village of Groton, the
main street running along the river bank; on an eminence
some hundred rods from the river, and commanding
a view of the surrounding country, including the
harbor and the islands which lie scattered near it in the
Sound, is the site of Fort Griswold. The old fort is now
in ruins, but in my time it was in tolerable repair. Our
company, as well as other portions of the militia, labored
upon it, and strengthened it, as well by completing its
works as by erecting a small redoubt upon the south-eastern
side. To the defence of the latter, in case of attack,
the Hartford company was assigned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The officers of our company were rigid disciplinarians,
and accordingly we were drilled for about four hours
each day. We soon gained much reputation for our
martial exercises and our tidy appearance. Many people
came over from New London to witness our performances,
among whom were often persons of distinction.
On Sundays we marched two miles to church, and being
in our best guise, caused quite a sensation. Men and
women, boys and girls, streamed along at our flanks,
often in a broiling sun, yet always with admiring looks.</p>

<p>After a morning drill we were generally at leisure for
the rest of the day, taking our turns, however, on guard,
and in other occasional duties. Most of the soldiers
gave up their rations of mess beef and potatoes, and
lived on their own resources. We formed ourselves into
a general club for a supply of fresh fish. Every day
three of us went out fishing, and generally returned with
a half-bushel basket full of various kinds, among which
the blackfish or tataug, now so greatly esteemed, was always
abundant. I was employed by the captain to keep
his journal of our proceedings, and sometimes I was
dispatched to New London, or to some one of the officers
along the line, with a letter or a parcel.</p>

<p>I remember that on one occasion H. A&mdash;&mdash;, my
special companion, and myself, were sent with a letter to
an officer who commanded a small picket on the eastern
shore, near the mouth of the river; that is, at Point
Groton. It was a distance of some three miles. The
weather was pleasant, and our route lay along the shore
of the stream, which opens into a wide bay as it meets
the Sound. As we approached the southern point of the
shore we found ourselves quite near to the British
squadron. One of the vessels, which we knew as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
"Acasta"&mdash;for we had learned all their names&mdash;was
under full sail in a light wind, and coming up toward
the shore. She was already so near that we could see
the men, and note every movement on the deck. While
we were admiring the beautiful appearance of the ship,
we suddenly saw several white puffs issue from her sides
and uncoil themselves into volumes of smoke. Then came
a deafening roar; a moment after, and in the very midst
of it, there were wild howls in the air above our heads.
At a little distance beyond the ground was ploughed up,
scattering the soil around, and the top of one of the
forest trees, of which a few were scattered here and
there, was cut asunder and fell almost at our feet.</p>

<p>We understood the joke in an instant, and so did the
lieutenant who commanded the picket. He was the
object of the attack, and the broadside of the "Acasta,"
sending its shot over our heads, had hurled one or two
balls crashing through the roof of the little fish-hut
which he and his men occupied. In less than five minutes
they were seen trotting off at a round pace, with
their cannon jerking right and left over the rough ground
behind them. Several other shots were fired, but the
party escaped in safety. My companion and myself ensconced
ourselves behind the rocks, and though it was
grave sport we enjoyed it exceedingly. We could trace
the cannon-balls as they flew by, looking like globes of
mist twinkling through the air. Several of them passed
close over our heads, and grooved the earth in long
trenches at our sides. The noise they made as they rose
high in the air was a strange mixture, between a howl
and a scream. After having thus showed her teeth and
made a great noise the frigate returned to her anchorage,
and all was quiet. I hope I shall not degrade myself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
a soldier in your eyes by confessing that this was the
only battle in which I was engaged during this glorious
war!</p>

<p>I must, however, mention one circumstance which
tried the souls of our company. On a certain Saturday
a large accession to the British force arrived in the bay,
the whole number of vessels of all kinds amounted to
fourteen. This looked very much like an attack, and accordingly
there was a feverish anxiety among the inhabitants
of New London and the vicinity, and a general
bustle in the army from Groton Point to Allyn's Mountain.
A large body of militia was set to work upon Fort
Griswold. Our company was drilled in the little redoubt
which we were to defend, and every preparation was
made to give the enemy a warm reception. The general
idea was, that a landing of British troops would be made
on the eastern side, and that we should take the brunt
of the first attack.</p>

<p>The sun set in clouds, and as the evening advanced
bursts of thunder, attended by flashes of lightning, muttered
along the distant horizon. Our company was admonished
to sleep on their arms. Everything wore a
rather ominous appearance. There were no signs of
cowardice in the men, but they looked thoughtful; and
when the wit of the company let off some of his best
jokes&mdash;which would ordinarily have set the whole corps
in a roar&mdash;he was answered by a dead silence. It
chanced that I was that night on guard. My turn came
at ten o'clock. Taking my gun, I paced the bank of the
river in front of our barracks. I had received orders to
let nothing pass by land or water. It was intensely
dark, but at frequent intervals thin flashes of lightning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
sprang up against the distant sky behind dark rolling
masses of clouds.</p>

<p>Gradually the lights in the streets and windows of
New London, stretching in a long line on the opposite
side of the river, were extinguished one by one; a few
remaining, however, as sentinels, indicating anxiety and
watchfulness. The sounds on all sides were at last hushed,
"and left the world to darkness and to me." More
than half of my two-hours' watch had passed when I
heard the dip of oars and the flapping of waves against
the prow of a boat. I looked in the direction of the
sounds, and at last descried the dusky outline of a small
craft stealing down the river. I cried out,&mdash;"Boat ahoy!
who goes there?" My voice echoed portentously in the
silence, but no answer was given, and the low, black, raking
apparition glided on its way. Again I challenged,
but there was still no reply. On went the ghost! I
cocked my gun. The click sounded ominously on the
still night air. I began to consider the horror of shooting
some fellow-being in the dark. I called a third time,
and not without avail. The rudder was turned, the boat
whirled on her heel, and a man came ashore. According
to my orders I marshalled him to the guard-room,
and gave notice of what had happened to the captain.
The man was only a fisherman going home, but he was
detained till morning. So, you see, I can boast that I
made one prisoner. My watch was soon over, and returning
to my station I laid down to sleep.</p>

<p>All was soon quiet, and I was buried in profound
repose, when suddenly there was a cry in the main barrack-room
overhead,&mdash;"Alarm! alarm!"</p>

<p>"Alarm! alarm!" was echoed by twenty voices, attended
by quick, shuffling sounds, and followed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
hurried rush of men down the staircase. A moment
after the guard in front discharged his musket, and was
answered by a long line of reports up and down the river,
from the various sentinels, extending for half-a-dozen
miles. Then came the roll of drums and the mustering
of the men. Several of our company had been out to
see what was going on: they came back saying that the
enemy was approaching! J. M&mdash;&mdash; distinctly heard the
roar of cannon, and positively saw the flash of muskets.
B. W&mdash;&mdash; found out that the attack had already begun
upon our southern pickets. Nobody doubted that our
time had come!</p>

<p>In a very few minutes our company was drawn up in
line, and the roll was called. It was still dark, but the
faint flash gave us now and then a glimpse of each other's
faces. I think we were a ghostly-looking set, but it was,
perhaps, owing to the blueish complexion of the light. J.
S&mdash;&mdash;, of West Hartford, who marched at my left
shoulder&mdash;usually the lightest-hearted fellow in the company&mdash;whispered
to me,&mdash;"Goodrich, I'd give fifty dollars
to be at West Division!" For myself, I felt rather
serious, and asked a certain anxious feeling in my
stomach,&mdash;"What's to be done?" Johnson, our captain,
was a man of nerve and ready speech. When the roll
was finished, he said in a clear, hearty tone,&mdash;"All right,
my good fellows! Every man at his post!" These few
words&mdash;which were, however, more politic than true, for
one fellow was taken with sudden colic, and could not be
got out&mdash;were electrical. We were ready to take our
places in the redoubt.</p>

<p>Messengers were now sent to the two neighboring
posts to inquire into the state of facts. Word was
brought that the first alarm came from our barracks!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
The matter was inquired into, and it turned out that the
whole affair was originated by a corporal of ours, who,
in a fit of nightmare, jumped up and cried,&mdash;"Alarm!
alarm!"</p>

<p>Our martial ardor soon reconciled itself to this rather
ludicrous denouement, though several persons, who had
been somewhat chapfallen, became suddenly inflated with
courage, which signalized itself with outbursts of "Hang
the British!" "They're a pack of sneaking cowards,
after all!" and the like. The next morning was fresh
and fair. The skirmishing thunder-gusts of the night
had cleared the air, and even distant objects seemed near
at hand. Before us lay the whole British fleet, still and
harmless, in the glassy bay. My lefthand chum, J.
S&mdash;&mdash;, who, in the dark hour, would have given fifty
dollars to be at West Division, was now himself again.
"Come on here, you black old Ramilies!" said he, dashing
the doubled fist of his right hand into the palm of his
left: "Come on here, you black-hearted British bull-dogs,
and we'll do your business for you!"</p>

<p>Our period of service was brief. In about six weeks
from the time of our departure we were dismissed, and
returned to our homes. Thus closed my military career,
so far as relates to active service. The remembrances of
my first and last campaign are, on the whole, pleasant.
There were feelings of fraternity established between the
members of the company which have continued to this
day. My country has not been unmindful of my services;
for I have received two land-warrants, giving me a
title to some hundred and sixty acres, with the fresh
virgin soil of the Far West upon them. Say not that
republics are ungrateful!</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">EFFECTS OF WAR IN NEW ENGLAND&mdash;PERSONAL EXPERIENCE&mdash;NEWS OF
PEACE&mdash;ILLUMINATIONS&mdash;CONFESSIONS.</p></blockquote>


<p>I remember perfectly well the universal state of
anxiety and depression which prevailed in New England
during the latter part of the war. The acts of government,
the movements of fleets and armies, furnish no
idea of the condition of society in its daily life. Let me
give you a few items as indications of the embarrassments,
vexations, and privations which the war had
brought unto every man's house and home. Such a thing
as silver or gold money was almost unknown. The chief
circulation consisted of bills of suspended banks, or what
were called "facilities;" that is, bank notes, authorized
by the legislature of Connecticut, redeemable in three
years after the war. These were at fifteen to twenty-five
per cent. discount compared with specie. Banks
issued notes of fifty, twenty-five, and twelve-and-a-half
cents. Barbers issued bills payable in shaving, and various
institutions adopted a similar course. The whole
mass acquired the title of "rag-money," "shin-plasters,"
&amp;c.: a large portion of it was notoriously worthless,
either as being counterfeit, or issued by irresponsible parties,
yet it generally passed without scrutiny.</p>

<p>I had personal experience of the universal depression.
In the summer of 1814 I was out of my time, and cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
about for some employment. I went to New York for
this object, but found not the slightest encouragement.
After some reflection I established a manufactory of
pocket-books, in connection with one of my friends, who
furnished the capital. The greatest difficulty was to find
the materials. I made expeditions to Boston, Charlestown,
Providence, &amp;c., and was not able to obtain over
fifty pieces of morocco fit for the purpose. In December
I went to New York, and was more successful. I
made a considerable purchase, and dispatched my goods
by the carrier. Pretty well content with my success, I
had gone in the evening to a concert at the City Hotel.
While listening to the music there was a murmur in the
streets. Soon the door of the concert-room was thrown
open, and in rushed a man all breathless with excitement.
He mounted on a table, and swinging a white handkerchief
aloft, cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peace! peace! peace!"</p>

<p>The music ceased: the hall was speedily vacated. I
rushed into the street, and oh, what a scene!</p>

<p>It was on the evening of Saturday, the 11th of February,
1815, that the news of the treaty of peace reached
New York. In half-an-hour after Broadway was one
living sea of shouting, rejoicing people. "Peace! peace!
peace!" was the deep, harmonious, universal anthem.
The whole spectacle was enlivened by a sudden inspiration.
Somebody came with a torch: the bright idea
passed into a thousand brains. In a few minutes thousands
and tens of thousands of people were marching
about with candles, lamps, torches, making the jubilant
street appear like a gay and gorgeous procession. The
whole night Broadway sang its song of peace. We were
all democrats&mdash;all federalists! Old enemies rushed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
each other's arms: every house was in a revel: every
heart seemed melted by a joy which banished all evil
thought and feeling. Nobody asked, that happy night,
what were the terms of the treaty: we had got peace&mdash;that
was enough! I moved about for hours in the
ebbing and flowing tide of people, not being aware that
I had opened my lips. The next morning I found that I
was hoarse from having joined in the exulting cry of
"Peace! peace!"</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday, all the churches sent up hymns
of thanksgiving for the joyous tidings. I set out in the
stage-coach on Monday morning for Connecticut. All
along the road the people saluted us with swinging of
hats and cries of rejoicing. At one place, in a rather
lonesome part of the road, a schoolmaster came with the
whole school at his heels to ask us if the news was true.
We told him it was; whereupon he tied his bandanna
pocket-handkerchief to a broom, swung it aloft, and the
whole school hosannaed, "Peace! peace!" At all our
stopping-places the people were gathered to rejoice in the
good tidings. At one little tavern I looked into a room, by
chance, the door being open, and there I saw the good-wife,
with a chubby boy in her lap&mdash;both in a perfect
gale of merriment&mdash;the child crying out, "Peath! peath!"
Oh, ye makers of war, reflect upon this heartfelt verdict
of the people in behalf of peace!</p>

<p>We arrived at New Haven in the evening, and found
it illuminated: the next day I reached Hartford, and
there also was a grand illumination. The news spread
over the country, carrying with it a wave of shouts and
rejoicings. Boston became clamorous with pealing bells;
the schools had a jubilee; the blockaded shipping, rotting
at the dilapidated wharves, got out their dusty buntings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and these, ragged and forlorn, now flapped merrily
in the breeze. At night the city flamed far and wide&mdash;from
Beacon street down the Bay, telling the glorious
tale even unto Cape Cod. So spread the news over the
country, everywhere, carrying joy to every heart&mdash;with,
perhaps, a single exception. At Washington, the authors
of the war peeped into the dispatches, and found that
the treaty had no stipulations against the Orders in Council,
Paper Blockades, and Impressments, which were the
pretexts for the war. All that could be maintained was,
that we had made war, charging the enemy with very
gross enormities, and we had made peace, saying not one
word about them!</p>

<p>So the war was ended.</p>

<p>Let us be frank, and confess the truth: the war, in the
aspects in which history thus presents it, was disgraceful
to the authors of it: it was, in many respects, disastrous
to the country; and yet it has left us some wholesome
lessons. It has shown the danger and folly of plunging
a great country into a national conflict for narrow and
selfish purposes, because, under such circumstances, the
people will be divided, and it will be a partisan, and not
a patriotic war; it has put on record another instance in
which war has been declared in boasting, and ended precisely
where it began, after years of violence, sorrow, and
bloodshed. It has shown, also&mdash;in connection with subsequent
events&mdash;the superiority of peace to war, even in
obtaining the ends of justice; for let it be remembered
that Daniel Webster extorted from Great Britain, by the
force of argument, that which the sword could not achieve.</p>

<p class="hang">EVIL EFFECTS OF NIGHT STUDY&mdash;COMMENCEMENT OF A LITERARY CAREER&mdash;THOUGHTS
ON DANCING&mdash;NEW YORK&mdash;SARATOGA&mdash;DEATH OF MY
UNCLE&mdash;BECOME A BOOKSELLER&mdash;COLD SUMMER&mdash;T'OTHER SIDE OF OHIO.</p></blockquote>


<p>I have told you that my apprenticeship terminated in
the summer of 1814. Previous to that time I had made
some advances in the study of the French language,
under M. Value, or, to give him his title, the Count
Value. This person had spent his early life in Paris, but
afterward migrated to St. Domingo, where he owned a
large estate. In the insurrection of 1794 he escaped
only with his life. With admirable cheerfulness and
serenity he devoted himself to teaching French and
dancing, as means of support. He settled for a time at
New Haven, where, at the age of seventy, he was captivated
by a tall, red-haired schoolmistress of twenty,
whom he married.</p>

<p>The Count finally established himself at Hartford, and
I became one of his pupils. I pursued my studies with
considerable assiduity, and to practise myself in French,
I translated Chateaubriand's René. One of my friends
had just established a newspaper at Middletown, and my
translation was published there. About this time my
health was feeble, and my eyes became seriously affected
in consequence of my night studies. Unaware of the
danger, I persevered, and thus laid the foundation of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
nervous weakness and irritability of my eyes, which has
since been to me a rock ahead in the whole voyage of
life. From that time I have never been able to read or
write without pain. As if by a kind of fatality, I seemed
to be afterwards drawn into a literary career, for which I
was doubly disqualified&mdash;first by an imperfect education,
and next by defective eyesight. Oh! what penalties
have I paid for thus persisting in a course which seems
to have been forbidden to me by Providence. After a
long and laborious life, I feel a profound consciousness
that I have done nothing well; at the same time, days,
months, nay years, have I struggled with the constant
apprehension that I should terminate my career in blindness!
How little do we know, especially in the outset
of our existence, what is before us! It is well that
we do not know, for the prospect would often overwhelm
us.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1814, as already stated, I established,
in company with a friend, a pocket-book factory at
Hartford; but the peace put a speedy termination to that
enterprise. We came out of it with a small loss, and my
kind-hearted partner pocketed this, "for he had money,
and I had none." He forgave me, and would have done
the same had the deficit been more considerable, for he
was a true friend.</p>

<p>Early in the following spring, I made an arrangement
to go to Paris as a clerk in the branch of the importing
house of Richards, Taylor &amp; Wilder, of New York.
About a month afterwards the news came that Napoleon
had suddenly returned from Elba, and as business was
prostrated by that event, my engagement failed. For
nearly a year, my health continued indifferent, and my
eyes in such a state that I was incapable of undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
any serious business. I spent my time partly at Berlin,
and partly at Hartford. I read a little, and practised my
French with Value and his scholars. I also felt the need
of disciplining my hands and feet, which about these
days seemed to me to have acquired a most absurd development,
giving me a feeling of great embarrassment
when I entered into company. I therefore took lessons
in dancing, and, whether I profited by it or not as to
manners, I am persuaded that this portion of my education
was highly beneficial to me in other points of
view.</p>

<p>As many good people have a prejudice against dancing,
I am disposed to write down my experience on the
subject. In the winter, our good old teacher had weekly
cotillion parties, for the purpose of improving his scholars.
The young men invited the young women, and
took them to these gatherings, and after the exercises
conducted them home again. I know this will sound
strange to those who only understand metropolitan manners
at the present day; but I never knew an instance,
in my own experience or observation, in which the
strictest propriety was departed from. These parties
took place in the evening: they began at eight o'clock,
and continued till ten or eleven&mdash;sometimes till twelve.
The company consisted entirely of young persons, from
fifteen to twenty years of age: they included the children
of the respectable inhabitants, with a number of
young ladies from the boarding-schools. Some of these
I have since seen the wives of bishops, senators, and
governors of States&mdash;filling the first stations to which
women can aspire in this country, and I am satisfied that
these Hartford parties, under the auspices of our amiable
and respected old teacher, were every way refining and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
elevating: not only did they impart ease of manner, but,
as I think, purity of sentiment.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1815 I paid a visit to New York, and
having letters of introduction to Oliver Wolcott and
Archibald Gracie, I called on these gentlemen. My
lodgings were at the City Hotel, situated on the western
side of Broadway, between Thames and Cedar Streets,
the space being now occupied by warehouses. It was
then the chief hotel of New York, and was kept by a
model landlord, named Jennings, with a model bar-keeper
by the name of Willard. The latter was said never to
sleep night or day, for at all hours he was at his post,
and never forgot a customer, even after an absence of
twenty years.</p>

<p>It was late in the spring, and Mr. Gracie called for me
and took me to his country seat, occupying a little promontory
on the western side of Hurlgate, a charming
spot. Contiguous to it were the summer residences of
many of the leading citizens of New York.</p>

<p>Here I spent a fortnight very agreeably. Mr. Gracie
was at this period distinguished alike on account of his
wealth, his intelligence, and his amiable and honorable
character. Never have I witnessed anything more charming&mdash;more
affectionate, dignified, and graceful, than the
intercourse of the family with one another. Not many
years after, Mr. Gracie lost his entire fortune by the
vicissitudes of commerce, but his character was beyond
the reach of accident. He is still remembered with
affectionate respect by all those whose memories reach
back to the times in which he flourished, and when it
might be said, without disparagement to any other man,
that he was the first merchant in New York.</p>

<p>Early in the ensuing summer, my uncle, Chauncey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Goodrich, being in bad health, paid a visit to Saratoga
and Ballston for the benefit of the waters, and I accompanied
him. We soon returned, however, for it was now
apparent that he had a disease of the heart, which was
rapidly tending to a fatal result. Experiencing great suffering
at intervals, he gradually yielded to the progress
of his malady, and at last, on the 18th of August, 1815,
while walking the room, and engaged in cheerful conversation,
he faltered, sank into a chair, and instantly expired.
"His death," says the historian, "was a shock to
the whole community. Party distinctions were forgotten,
under a sense of the general calamity; and in the
simple but expressive language which was used at his
funeral, 'all united in a tribute of respect to the man who
had so long been dear to us, and done us so much good.'"
To me, the loss was irreparable; leaving, however, in my
heart a feeling of gratitude that I had witnessed an example
of the highest intellectual power united with the
greatest moral excellence, and that, too, in one whose
relationship to me enforced and commended its teachings
to my special observance. Alas, how little have I done
in life that is worthy of such inspiration!</p>

<p>Not long after this, my friend George Sheldon, who
had established himself as a bookseller and publisher,
invited me to become his partner, and this I did early in
the year 1816. We pursued the business for nearly two
years, during which time we published, among other
works, Scott's Family Bible, in five volumes quarto&mdash;a
considerable enterprise for that period in a place like
Hartford. In the autumn of 1817 I had gone to Berlin,
for the purpose of making a short excursion for the
benefit of my health, when a messenger came from Hartford,
saying that my partner was very ill, and wished me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to return. I immediately complied, and on entering the
room of my friend I found him in a high fever, his mind
already wandering in painful dreams. As I came to his
bedside he said,&mdash;"Oh, take away these horrid knives,
they cut me to the heart!" I stooped over him and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are no knives here; you are only dreaming."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it you?" said he. "I am glad you have come.
Do stay with me, and speak to me, so as to keep off these
dreadful fancies."</p>

<p>I did stay by him for four days and nights; but his
doom was sealed. His mind continued in a state of wild
delirium till a few minutes before his death. I stood
gazing at his face, when a sudden change came over him:
the agitated and disturbed look of insanity had passed&mdash;a
quiet pallor had come over his countenance, leaving it
calm and peaceful. He opened his eyes, and, as if waking
from sleep, looked on me with an aspect of recognition.
His lips moved, and he pronounced the name of
his wife: she came, with all the feelings of youth and
love&mdash;ay, and of hope, too, in her heart. She bent over
him: he raised his feeble and emaciated arms and clasped
her to his heart: he gave her one kiss, and passed to
another life!</p>

<p>The summer of 1816 was probably the coldest that
has been known in this century. In New England&mdash;from
Connecticut to Maine&mdash;there were severe frosts in
every month. The crop of Indian corn was almost
entirely cut off: of potatoes, hay, oats, &amp;c., there was
not, probably, more than half the usual supply. The
means of averting the effects of such a calamity&mdash;now
afforded by railroads, steam navigation, canals, and other
facilities of intercommunication&mdash;did not then exist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
The following winter was severe, and the ensuing spring
backward. At this time I made a journey into New
Hampshire, passing along the Connecticut river, in the
region of Hanover. It was then June, and the hills were
almost as barren as in November. I saw a man at
Orford who had been forty miles for a half-bushel of
Indian corn, and paid two dollars for it!</p>

<p>Along the seaboard it was not difficult to obtain a
supply of food, although every article was dear. In the
interior it was otherwise: the cattle died for want of fodder,
and many of the inhabitants nearly perished from
starvation. The desolating effects of the war still lingered
over the country, and at last a kind of despair seized
upon some of the people. In the pressure of adversity
many persons lost their judgment, and thousands feared
or felt that New England was destined, henceforth, to become
a part of the frigid zone. At the same time, Ohio&mdash;with
its rich soil, its mild climate, its inviting prairies&mdash;was
opened fully upon the alarmed and anxious vision.
As was natural under the circumstances, a sort of
stampede took place from cold, desolate, worn-out New
England, to this land of promise.</p>

<p>I remember very well the tide of emigration through
Connecticut on its way to the West, during the summer
of 1817. Some persons went in covered wagons&mdash;frequently
a family consisting of father, mother, and nine
small children, with one at the breast&mdash;some on foot, and
some crowded together under the cover, with kettle,
gridirons, feather-beds, crockery, and the family Bible,
Watts's Psalms and Hymns, and Webster's Spelling
book&mdash;the lares and penates of the household. Others
started in ox-carts, and trudged on at the rate of ten
miles a-day. In several instances I saw families on foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&mdash;the
father and boys taking turns in dragging along an
improvised hand-wagon, loaded with the wreck of the
household goods&mdash;occasionally giving the mother and
baby a ride. Many of these persons were in a state of
poverty, and begged their way as they went. Some died
before they reached the expected Canaan; many perished
after their arrival, from fatigue and privation; and others
from the fever and ague, which was then certain to
attack the new settlers.</p>

<p>It was, I think, in 1818, that I published a small tract,
entitled, "T'other Side of Ohio," that is, the other view,
in contrast to the popular notion that it was the paradise
of the world. It was written by Dr. Hand, a talented
young physician of Berlin, who had made a visit to the
West about this time. It consisted mainly of vivid but
painful pictures of the accidents and incidents attending
this wholesale migration. The roads over the Alleghanies,
between Philadelphia and Pittsburg, were then
rude, steep, and dangerous, and some of the more precipitous
slopes were consequently strewn with the carcases
of wagons, carts, horses, oxen, which had made ship-wreck
in their perilous descents. The scenes on the
road&mdash;of families gathered at night in miserable sheds,
called taverns&mdash;mothers frying, children crying, fathers
swearing, were a mingled comedy and tragedy of errors.
Even when they arrived at their new homes, along the
banks of the Muskingum, or the Scioto, frequently the
whole family&mdash;father, mother, children&mdash;speedily exchanged
the fresh complexion and elastic step of their
first abodes, for the sunken cheek and languid movement,
which mark the victim of intermittent fever.</p>

<p>The instances of homesickness, described by this vivid
sketcher, were touching. Not even the captive Israelites,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
who hung their harps upon the willows along the banks
of the Euphrates, wept more bitter tears, or looked back
with more longing to their native homes, than did these
exiles from New England; mourning the land they had
left, with its roads, schools, meeting-houses; its hope,
health, and happiness! Two instances, related by the
traveller, I must mention. He was one day riding in
the woods, apart from the settlements, when he met a
youth some eighteen years of age, in a hunting-frock, and
with a fowling-piece in his hand. The two fell into
conversation.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?" said the youth, at last.</p>

<p>"From Connecticut," was the reply.</p>

<p>"That is near the old Bay State?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And have you been there?"</p>

<p>"To Massachusetts? Yes, many a time."</p>

<p>"Let me take your hand, stranger. My mother was
from the Bay State, and brought me here when I was an
infant. I have heard her speak of it. Oh, it must be a
lovely land! I wish I could see a meeting-house and a
school-house, for she is always talking about them. And
the sea&mdash;the sea&mdash;oh, if I could see that! Did you ever
see it, stranger?"</p>

<p>"Yes, often."</p>

<p>"What, the real, salt sea&mdash;the ocean&mdash;with the ships
upon it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well," said the youth, scarcely able to suppress his
emotion, "if I could see the old Bay State and the
ocean, I should be willing then to die!"</p>

<p>In another instance the traveller met, somewhere in
the valley of the Scioto, a man from Hartford, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
name of Bull. He was a severe democrat, and feeling
sorely oppressed with the idea that he was no better off
in Connecticut under federalism than the Hebrews in
Egypt, joined the throng and migrated to Ohio. He was
a man of substance, but his wealth was of little avail in
a new country, where all the comforts and luxuries of
civilization were unknown.</p>

<p>"When I left Connecticut," said he, "I was wretched
from thinking of the sins of federalism. After I had got
across Byram river, which divides that State from New
York, I knelt down and thanked the Lord for that He
had brought me and mine out of such a priest-ridden
land. But I've been well punished, and I'm now preparing
to return; when I again cross Byram river, I shall
thank God that He has permitted me to get back again!"</p>

<p class="hang">MARRIAGE&mdash;WALTER SCOTT&mdash;BYRON&mdash;SIDNEY SMITH'S TAUNT&mdash;PUBLICATION
OF ORIGINAL AMERICAN WORKS&mdash;MRS. SIGOURNEY.</p></blockquote>


<p>Early in the year 1818 I was married to the daughter
of Stephen Rowe Bradley, of Westminster, Vermont.
Thus established in life, I pursued the business of bookseller
and publisher at Hartford for four years. My vocation
gave me the command of books, but I was able to
read very little&mdash;my eyes continuing to be so weak that
I could hardly do justice to my affairs. However, I dipped
into a good many books, and acquired a considerable
knowledge of authors and their works.</p>

<p>During the period in which Scott had been enchanting
the world with his poetry&mdash;that is, from 1805 to 1815&mdash;I
had shared in the general intoxication. The Lady of
the Lake delighted me beyond expression, and even now,
it seems to me the most pleasing and perfect of metrical
romances. These productions seized powerfully upon the
popular mind, partly on account of the romance of their
revelations, and partly also because of the simplicity of
the style, and the easy flow of the versification. Everybody
could read and comprehend them. One of my
younger sisters committed the whole of the Lady of the
Lake to memory, and was accustomed of an evening to
sit at her sewing, while she recited it to an admiring circle
of listeners. All young poets were inoculated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the octo-syllabic verse, and newspapers, magazines, and
even volumes, teemed with imitations and variations inspired
by the "Wizard Harp of the North." Not only
did Scott himself continue to pour out volume after
volume, but others produced set poems in his style, some
of them so close in their imitation as to be supposed the
works of Scott himself, trying the effect of a disguise.
At last, however, the market was overstocked, and the
general appetite began to pall with a surfeit, when a
sudden change took place in the public taste.</p>

<p>It was just at this point that Byron produced his first
canto of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. Scott speedily appreciated
the eclipse to which his poetical career was
doomed by the rising genius of Byron. He now turned
his attention to prose fiction, and in July, 1814, completed
and published Waverley, which had been begun
some eight or ten years before. Guy Mannering came
out the next year, and was received with a certain degree
of eagerness. The Antiquary, Black Dwarf, Old Mortality,
Rob Roy, and the Heart of Mid-Lothian, followed
in quick succession. I suspect that never, in any age,
have the productions of any author created in the world
so wide and deep an enthusiasm. This emotion reached
its height upon the appearance of Ivanhoe in 1819, which,
I think, proved the most popular of these marvellous productions.</p>

<p>At this period, although there was a good deal of mystery
as to their authorship, the public generally referred
them to Scott. He was called the "Great Unknown"&mdash;a
title which served to create even an adventitious interest
in his career. The appearance of a new tale from his
pen caused a greater sensation in the United States than
did some of the battles of Napoleon, which decided the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
fate of thrones and empires. Everybody read these
works; everybody&mdash;the refined and the simple&mdash;shared
in the delightful dreams which seemed to transport them
to remote ages and distant climes, and made them live
and breathe in the presence of the stern Covenanters of
Scotland, the gallant bowmen of Sherwood Forest, or
even the Crusaders in Palestine, where C&oelig;ur de Lion and
Saladin were seen struggling for the mastery! I can testify
to my own share in this intoxication. I was not
able, on account of my eyes, to read these works myself,
but I found friends to read them to me. To one good
old maid&mdash;Heaven bless her!&mdash;I was indebted for the
perusal of no less than seven of these tales.</p>

<p>Of course, there were many editions of these works in
the United States, and among others, I published an
edition, I think, in eight volumes, octavo&mdash;including
those which had appeared at that time.</p>

<p>About this time I began to think of trying to bring out
original American works. It must be remembered that I
am speaking of a period prior to 1820. At that date,
Bryant, Irving, and Cooper, the founders of our modern
literature, had just commenced their literary career.
Neither of them had acquired a positive reputation.
Halleck, Percival, Brainard, Longfellow, Willis, were at
school&mdash;at least, all were unknown. The general impression
was that we had not, and could not have, a literature.
It was the precise point at which Sydney Smith
had uttered that bitter taunt in the Edinburgh Review&mdash;"Who
reads an American book?" It proved to be that
"darkest hour just before the dawn." The successful
booksellers of the country were for the most part the
mere reproducers and sellers of English books. It was
positively injurious to the commercial credit of a bookseller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to undertake American works, unless they might
be Morse's Geographies, classical books, school-books, devotional
books, or other utilitarian works.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, about this time, I published an edition
of Trumbull's poems, in two volumes, octavo, and paid
him a thousand dollars and a hundred copies of the
work, for the copyright. I was seriously counselled
against this by several booksellers&mdash;and, in fact, Trumbull
had sought a publisher in vain for several years previous.
There was an association of designers and engravers
at Hartford, called the "Graphic Company," and
as I desired to patronize the liberal arts there, I employed
them to execute the embellishments. For so considerable
an enterprise, I took the precaution to get a subscription,
in which I was tolerably successful. The work was
at last produced, but it did not come up to the public expectation,
or the patriotic zeal had cooled, and more than
half the subscribers declined taking the work. I did not
press it, but putting a good face upon the affair, I let it
pass, and&mdash;while the public supposed I had made money
by my enterprise, and even the author looked askance at
me in the jealous apprehension that I had made too
good a bargain out of him&mdash;I quietly pocketed a loss of
about a thousand dollars. This was my first serious adventure
in patronizing American literature.</p>

<p>About the same period I turned my attention to books
for education and books for children, being strongly impressed
with the idea that there was here a large field for
improvement. I wrote, myself, a small arithmetic, and
half-a-dozen toy-books, and published them anonymously.
I also employed several persons to write school histories,
and educational manuals of chemistry, natural philosophy,
&amp;c., upon plans which I prescribed&mdash;all of which I published;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
but none of these were very successful at that
time. Some of them, passing into other hands, are now
among the most popular and profitable school-books in
the country.</p>

<p>It was before this period that Miss Huntly, now Mrs.
Sigourney, was induced to leave her home in Norwich,
and make Hartford her residence. This occurred about
the year 1814. Ere long she was the presiding genius
of our social circle. I shall not write her history, nor dilate
upon her literary career, yet I may speak of her influence
in this new relation&mdash;a part of which fell upon
myself. Mingling in the gayeties of our social gatherings,
and in no respect clouding their festivity, she led us
all toward intellectual pursuits and amusements. We
had even a literary coterie under her inspiration, its first
meetings being held at Mr. Wadsworth's. I believe one
of my earliest attempts at composition was made here.
The ripples thus begun, extended over the whole surface
of our young society, producing a lasting and refining
effect. It could not but be beneficial thus to mingle in
intercourse with one who has the faculty of seeing poetry
in all things and good everywhere. Few persons living
have exercised a wider influence than Mrs. Sigourney.
No one that I now know can look back upon a long and
earnest career of such unblemished beneficence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">DOMESTIC TROUBLES&mdash;SKETCH OF BRAINARD&mdash;AUNT LUCY'S BACK-PARLOR&mdash;THE
FALL OF NIAGARA&mdash;DEATH OF BRAINARD.</p></blockquote>


<p>In 1821, clouds and darkness began to gather around
my path. By a fall from a horse, I was put upon crutches
for more than a year, and a cane for the rest of my life.
Ere long death entered my door, and my home was
desolate. I was once more alone&mdash;save only that a
child was left me, to grow to womanhood, and to die a
youthful mother, loving and beloved. My affairs became
embarrassed, my health failed, and my only hope of
renovation was in a change of scene.</p>

<p>Before I give you a sketch of my experience and observations
abroad, I must present the portrait of my
friend Brainard. He came to Hartford in February,
1822, to take the editorial charge of the Connecticut
Mirror. He was now twenty-six years old, and had
gained some reputation for wit and poetical talent. One
day a young man, small in stature, with a curious mixture
of ease and awkwardness, of humor and humility, came
into my office, and introduced himself as Mr. Brainard.
I gave him a hearty welcome, for I had heard very
pleasant accounts of him. As was natural, I made a
complimentary allusion to his poems, which I had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and admired. A smile, yet shaded with something of
melancholy, came over his face as he replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't expect too much of me; I never succeeded in
anything yet. I never could draw a mug of cider without
spilling more than half of it!"</p>

<p>I afterwards found that much truth was thus spoken in
jest. This was, in point of fact, precisely Brainard's appreciation
of himself. All his life, feeling that he could
do something, he still entertained a mournful and disheartening
conviction that, on the whole, he was doomed
to failure and disappointment. There was sad prophecy
in this presentment&mdash;a prophecy which he at once made
and fulfilled.</p>

<p>We soon became friends, and, at last, intimates. I was
now boarding at "Ripley's"&mdash;a good old-fashioned tavern,
over which presided Major Ripley, respected for revolutionary
services, an amiable character, and a long Continental
queue. In the administration of the establishment
he was ably supported by his daughter, Aunt Lucy&mdash;the
very genius of tavern courtesy, cookery, and comfort.
Here Brainard joined me, and we took rooms side
by side. Thus, for more than a year, we were together,
as intimate as brothers. He was of a child-like disposition,
and craved constant sympathy. He soon got into
the habit of depending upon me in many things, and at
last&mdash;especially in dull weather, or when he was sad, or
something went wrong with him&mdash;he would creep into
my bed, as if it were his right. At that period of gloom
in my own fortunes, this was as well a solace to me as to
him. After my return from Europe we resumed these
relations, and for some months more we were thus
together.</p>

<p>I cannot do better than sketch a single incident, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
will give you some insight into Brainard's character.
The scene opens in Miss Lucy's little back-parlor&mdash;a
small, cosy, carpeted room, with two cushioned rocking-chairs,
and a bright hickory fire. It is a chill November
night, about seven o'clock of a Friday evening. The
Mirror&mdash;Brainard's paper&mdash;is to appear the next morning.
The week has thus far passed, and he has not written
for it a line. How the days have gone he can hardly
tell. He has read a little&mdash;dipped into Byron, pored
over the last Waverly novel, and been to see his friends;
at all events, he has got rid of the time. He has not
felt competent to bend down to his work, and has put it
off till the last moment. No further delay is possible.
He is now not well; he has a severe cold.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy, who takes a motherly interest in him, tells
him not to go out, and his own inclinations suggest the
charms of a quiet evening in the rocking chair, by a good
fire&mdash;especially in comparison with going to his comfortless
office, and drudging for the press. He lingers till
eight, and then suddenly rousing himself, by a desperate
effort, throws on his cloak and sallies forth. As was not
uncommon, I go with him. A dim fire is kindled in the
small Franklin stove in his office, and we sit down.
Brainard, as was his wont, especially when he was in
trouble, falls into a curious train of reflections, half comic
and half serious.</p>

<p>"Would to Heaven," he says, "I were a slave! I think
a slave, with a good master, has a good time of it. The
responsibility of taking care of himself&mdash;the most terrible
burden of life&mdash;is put on his master's shoulders. Madame
Roland, with a slight alteration, would have uttered a
profound truth. She should have said&mdash;'Oh, Liberty,
Liberty, thou art a humbug!' After all, liberty is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
greatest possible slavery, for it puts upon a man the responsibility
of taking care of himself. If he goes wrong,
why, he's condemned! If a slave sins, he's only flogged,
and gets over it, and there's an end of it. Now, if I could
only be flogged, and settle the matter that way, I should
be perfectly happy. But here comes my tormentor."</p>

<p>The door is now opened, a boy with a touselled head
and inky countenance enters, saying curtly&mdash;"Copy, Mr.
Brainard!"</p>

<p>"Come in fifteen minutes!" says the editor, with a droll
mixture of fun and despair.</p>

<p><a name="whittle" id="whittle">&nbsp;</a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">
<img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="381" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WHITTLING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Brainard makes a few observations, and sits down at
his little narrow pine table&mdash;hacked along edges with
many a restless penknife. He seems to notice the
marks, and pausing a moment, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This table reminds me of one of my brother William's
stories. There was an old man in Groton, who
had but one child, and she was a daughter. When she
was about eighteen, several young men came to see her.
At last she picked out one of them, and desired to marry
him. He seemed a fit match enough, but the father
positively refused his consent. For a long time he persisted,
and would give no reason for his conduct. At
last he took his daughter aside, and said&mdash;'Now, Sarah,
I think pretty well of this young man in general, but
I've observed that he's given to whittling. There's no
harm in that, but the point is this: he whittles and
whittles, and never makes nothing! Now, I tell you,
I'll never give my only daughter to such a feller as that!'
Whenever Bill told this story, he used to insinuate that
this whittling chap, who never made anything, was me!
At any rate, I think it would have suited me exactly."</p>

<p>Some time passed in similar talk, when, at last, Brainard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
turned suddenly, took up his pen, and began to
write. I sat apart, and left him to his work. Some
twenty minutes passed, when, with a smile on his face,
he got up, approached the fire, and taking the candle to
light his paper, read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"THE FALLS OF NIAGARA.</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The thoughts are strange that crowd into my brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I look upwards to thee. It would seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if God pour'd thee from his 'hollow hand,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung his bow upon thy awful front;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spoke in that loud voice that seem'd to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who dwelt in Patmos for his Saviour's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The sound of many waters;' and had bade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy flood to chronicle the ages back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And notch his cent'ries in the eternal rocks!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He had hardly done reading when the boy came.
Brainard handed him the lines&mdash;on a small scrap of
coarse paper&mdash;and told him to come again in half-an-hour.
Before this time had elapsed, he had finished and
read me the following stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Deep calleth unto deep. And what are we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hear the question of that voice sublime?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! what are all the notes that ever rung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From war's vain trumpet by thy thundering side?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, what is all the riot man can make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his short life, to thy unceasing roar?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, bold babbler, what art thou to Him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who drown'd a world, and heap'd the waters far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above its loftiest mountains? A light wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That breathes and whispers of its Maker's might."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These lines having been furnished, Brainard left his
office, and we returned to Miss Lucy's parlor. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
seemed utterly unconscious of what he had done. I
praised the verses, but he thought I only spoke warmly
from friendly interest. The lines went forth, and produced
a sensation of delight over the whole country.
Almost every exchange paper that came to the office had
extracted them. Even then he would scarcely believe
that he had done anything very clever. And thus, under
these precise circumstances, were composed the most
suggestive and sublime stanzas upon Niagara that were
ever penned. Brainard had never, as he told me, been
within less than five hundred miles of the cataract, nor
do I believe that, when he went to the office, he had
meditated upon the subject.</p>

<p>The reader will see, from the circumstances I have
mentioned, that I know the history of most of Brainard's
pieces, as they came out, from time to time, in his newspaper.
Nearly all of them were occasional&mdash;that is,
suggested by passing events, or incidents in the poet's
experience.</p>

<p>Early in the year 1825 I persuaded Brainard to make
a collection of his poems, and have them published. At
first his lip curled at the idea, as being too pretentious.
He insisted that he had done nothing to justify the publication
of a volume. Gradually he began to think of it,
and, at length, I induced him to sign a contract authorizing
me to make arrangements for the work. He set
about the preparation, and at length&mdash;after much lagging
and many lapses&mdash;the pieces were selected and arranged.
When all was ready, I persuaded him to go to New York
with me to settle the matter with a publisher.</p>

<p>One anecdote, in addition to those already before the
public, and I shall close this sketch. Brainard's talent
for repartee was of the first order. On one occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Nathan Smith, an eminent lawyer, was at Ripley's tavern,
in the midst of a circle of judges and lawyers attending
the court. He was an Episcopalian, and at this time
was considered by his political adversaries&mdash;unjustly, no
doubt&mdash;as the paid agent of that persuasion, now clamoring
for a sum of money from the State, to lay the
foundation of a "Bishops' Fund." He was thus regarded
somewhat in the same light as O'Connell, who, while
he was the great patriot leader of Irish independence,
was, at the same time, liberally supported by the "rint."
By accident, Brainard came in, and Smith, noticing a
little feathery attempt at whiskers down his cheeks,
rallied him upon it.</p>

<p>"It will never do," said he; "you cannot raise it,
Brainard. Come, here's sixpence&mdash;take that, and go to
the barber's and get it shaved off! It will smooth your
cheek, and ease your conscience."</p>

<p>Brainard drew himself up, and said with great dignity&mdash;as
Smith held out the sixpence on the point of his
forefinger&mdash;"No, sir, you had better keep it for the
Bishops' Fund!"</p>

<p>In Brainard's editorial career&mdash;though he was negligent,
dilatory, sometimes almost imbecile, from a sort of
constitutional inertness&mdash;still a train of inextinguishable
light remains to gleam along his path. Many a busy,
toiling editor has filled his daily columns for years, without
leaving a living page behind him; while Brainard,
with all his failings and irregularities, has left a collection
of gems which will be cherished to immortality. And
among all that he wrote idly and recklessly, as it might
seem&mdash;there is not a line that, "dying, he could wish to
blot." His love of parents, of home, of kindred, was
beautiful indeed; his love of nature, and especially of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the scenes of his childhood, was the affection of one
never weaned from the remembrance of his mother's
breast. He was true in friendship, chivalrous in all that
belonged to personal honor. I never heard him utter a
malignant thought&mdash;I never knew him to pursue an unjust
design. At the early age of eight-and-twenty, with
a submissive spirit, he resigned himself to death, and in
pious, gentle, cheerful faith, he departed on the 26th of
September, 1828.</p>

<p class="hang">MY FIRST VISIT TO EUROPE&mdash;HURRICANE&mdash;ARRIVAL AT LIVERPOOL&mdash;LONDON&mdash;TRAVEL
ON THE CONTINENT&mdash;RETURN TO BRISTOL&mdash;INTERVIEW WITH
HANNAH MORE&mdash;DESIGN IN TRAVELLING&mdash;VISIT TO IRELAND AND SCOTLAND.</p></blockquote>


<p>It was on the 16th of November, 1823, that I set sail
in the "Canada," Captain Macy, on my first visit to
Europe. I have now before me four volumes of notes
made during my tour; which I might, perhaps, have ventured
to publish when they were fresh; but since that
period the world has been inundated with tales of travels,
I shall therefore only indulge in a rapid outline of my
adventures, and a few sketches of men and things, which
may perchance be of interest to the reader.</p>

<p>Our voyage was, as usual at that season of the year,
tempestuous. As we approached the British Islands we
were beset by a regular hurricane. On the 5th of December,
the Captain kindly informed us that we were
almost precisely in the situation of the "Albion," the day
before she was wrecked on the rocky headland of Kinsale,
at the south-east extremity of Ireland; an event
which had spread a general gloom throughout the
United States. As night set in we were struck by a
squall, and with difficulty the vessel was brought round,
so as to lie to. The storm was fearful; and the frequent
concussions of the waves upon the ship, sounding like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
reports of artillery, made her reel and stagger like a
drunken man. The morning came at last, and the
weather was fair, but our deck was swept of its boats,
bulwarks, and hen-coops. Our old cow in her hovel, the
covering of the steerage, and that of the companion-way,
were saved. The next morning we took a pilot, and on
the 8th of December entered the dock at Liverpool.</p>

<p>I had suffered fearfully by sea-sickness, and had
scarcely strength to walk ashore. I felt such horror&mdash;such
disgust of the sea&mdash;that I could easily have pledged
myself never to venture upon it again. However, this
all passed away like a dream: my strength revived; and
even my constitution, shattered by long suffering, seemed
to be renovated. With the return of health and spirits,
my journey to London was delightful. Though it was
December, the landscape was intensely green, while the
atmosphere was dark as twilight. And this was England!
Oh, what emotions filled my breast as I looked
on Kenilworth, Warwick, and Lichfield, and at last on
London!</p>

<p>I remained in the latter place about a month, and then
went to Paris. In April I visited Switzerland and a portion
of Germany, and followed the Rhine to Cologne.
Thence I travelled through Flanders and Holland, and
taking a sloop at Rotterdam, swung down the Maese, and
in May reached London again. I soon after departed for
Bristol, taking Salisbury and Stonehenge on my way.
Having reached that city, and seen its sights, I hired a
post-coach, and went to Barley-wood, some ten miles
distant. Hannah More was still living there! The
house was a small thatched edifice&mdash;half cottage and
half villa&mdash;tidily kept, and garnished with vines and
trellises. Its site was on a gentle hill, sloping to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
south-east, and commanding a charming view over the
undulating country around, including the adjacent village
of Wrington, with a wide valley sloping to the Bristol
Channel; the latter sparkling in the distance, and
bounded by the Welsh mountains in the far horizon.
Behind the house, and on the crown of the hill, was a
small copse, threaded with neat gravel walks, and at particular
points embellished with objects of interest. In
one place there was a little rustic temple, with this motto&mdash;"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Audi,
Hospes, contemnere opes</i>;" in another, there
was a stone monument, erected to the memory of Bishop
Porteus, who had been a particular friend of the proprietor
of the place. A little further on I found another
monument, with this inscription: "<i>To John Locke,
born in this village, this monument is erected by Mrs.
Montague, and presented to Hannah More.</i>" From this
sequestered spot an artificial opening was cut through the
foliage of the trees, giving a view of the house&mdash;about a
mile distant&mdash;in which Locke was born!</p>

<p>Mrs. More was now seventy-nine years of age, and was
very infirm, having kept her room for two years. She
received me with great cordiality, and mentioned several
Americans who had visited her, and others, with whom
she had held correspondence. Her mind and feelings
were alive to every subject that was suggested. She
spoke very freely of her writings and her career. I told
her of the interest I had taken, when a child, in the
story of the Shepherd of Salisbury Plain; upon which
she recounted its history, remarking that the character
of the hero was modelled from life, though the incidents
were fictitious. Her tract, called Village Politics, by
Will Chip, was written at the request of the British Ministry,
and two million copies were sold the first year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
She showed me copies of C&oelig;lebs in Search of a Wife&mdash;the
most successful of her works&mdash;in French and German;
and a copy of one of her Sacred Dramas, Moses in
the Bulrushes, on palm-leaves, in the Cingalese tongue;
it having been translated into that language by the Missionary
School at Ceylon. She showed me also the
knife with which the leaf had been prepared, and the
scratches made in it to receive the ink. She expressed a
warm interest in America, and stated that Wilberforce
had always exerted himself to establish and maintain
good relations between Great Britain and our country. I
suggested to her that, in the United States, the general
impression&mdash;that of the great mass of the people&mdash;was
that the English were unfriendly to us. She said it was
not so. I replied that the Americans all read the English
newspapers, and generally the products of the British
press; that feelings of dislike, disgust, animosity, certainly
pervaded most of these publications; and it was
natural to suppose that these were the reflections of public
opinion in Great Britain: at all events, our people regarded
them as such, and hence inferred that England
was our enemy. She expressed great regret at this
state of things, and said all good people should strive to
keep peace between the two countries: to all which I
warmly assented.</p>

<p>My interview with this excellent lady was, on the
whole, most gratifying. Regarding her as one of the
greatest benefactors of the age&mdash;as, indeed, one of the
most remarkable women that had ever lived&mdash;I looked
upon her not only with veneration, but affection. Besides,
I felt that I owed her a special debt; and my visit
to her was almost like a pilgrimage to the shrine of a
divinity. When I left America, I had it in mind to render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
my travels subservient to a desire I had long entertained
of making an improvement in books for the young.
I had sought in London, France, and Germany, for works
that might aid my design. It is true I had little success;
for while scientific and classical education was sedulously
encouraged on the Continent, as well as in England, it
seemed to be thought that Dilworth and Mother Goose
had done all that could be done. In this interview with
Mrs. More I had the subject still in mind; and discerning
by what she had accomplished the vast field that was
open, and actually inviting cultivation, I began from this
time to think of attempting to realize the project I had
formed. It is true that, in some respects, the example I
had just contemplated differed from my own scheme.
Hannah More had written chiefly for the grown-up
masses; whereas my plan was to begin further back&mdash;with
the children. Her means, however, seemed adapted
to my purpose: her success, to encourage my attempt.
She had discovered that truth could be made attractive
to simple minds. Fiction was, indeed, often her vehicle;
but it was not her end. The great charm of these works,
which had captivated the million, was their verisimilitude.
Was there not, then, a natural relish for truth in all
minds; or, at least, was there not a way of presenting it,
which made it even more interesting than romance? Did
not children love truth? If so, was it necessary to feed
them on fiction? Could not History, Natural History,
Geography, Biography, become the elements of juvenile
works, in place of fairies and giants, and mere monsters
of the imagination? These were the inquiries that from
this time filled my mind.</p>

<p>Taking leave of Barley-wood and its interesting
occupant, I traversed Wales, and embarking at Holyhead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
passed over to Ireland. Having seen Dublin, with
the extraordinary contrasts of sumptuousness in some of
its streets and edifices, with the fearful squalidness and
poverty in others, I passed on to the North; and after
visiting the Giant's Causeway returned to Belfast, and
embarked in a steamboat for Greenock. Thence I proceeded
toward Dumbarton, and in the early evening, as I
approached the town in a small steamer, I realized in the
distance before me the scene of the song,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sun has gone down o'er the lofty Ben Lomond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the red clouds to preside o'er the scene."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the morrow I went to Loch Lomond, crossing the
lake in a steamboat; thence on foot to Callender; and
spent two days around Loch Katrine, amid the scenery
of the Lady of the Lake. With a copy of that poem in
my hand, which I had bought of a countryman on the
borders of Loch Lomond, I easily traced out the principal
landmarks of the story: "Ellen's Isle," nearly in the
middle of the lake; on the northern shore, "the Silver
Strand," where the maiden met Fitz-James; far to the
east, Benain, rearing its "forehead fair" to the sky; to
the south, the rocky pyramid called "Roderick's Watchtower;"
and still beyond, the "Goblin's Cave." Leaving
the lake, I passed through the Trosachs, a wild, rocky
glen, and the scene of the most startling events in the
poem. At last I came to Coilantogle Ford, where the
deadly struggle took place between the two heroes of the
poem&mdash;Roderick and Fitz-James. Finally, I went to the
borders of Loch Achray, a placid sheet of water, beautiful
by nature, but still more enchanting through the delightful
associations of poetic art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">

<p>But I must forbear. I have pledged myself not to
weary my reader with descriptions of scenery, and
especially with that which is familiar to every one. I
will try not to sin again: at least till I get out of Scotland.
Having spent two days in this region of poetry
and romance, I left for Glasgow, and at last reached
Edinburgh.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">THE EDINBURGH LIONS&mdash;LITERARY CELEBRITIES&mdash;JEFFREY IN THE FORUM&mdash;SIR
WALTER AT THE DESK&mdash;RIDING WITH SCOTCH LADIES&mdash;BEAUTIFUL
SCENERY&mdash;A SCOTCH MIST.</p></blockquote>


<p>Edinburgh was then decidedly the literary metropolis
of the three kingdoms; not through the amount of its
productions, but their superiority. I had several letters
of introduction; among them one to Blackwood; another
to Constable; another to Miss Y&mdash;&mdash;. The latter proved
fortunate. Her father was a Writer to the Signet; an
elderly gentleman of excellent position, and exceedingly
fond of showing off "Auld Reekie." Well, indeed,
might he be; for of all the cities I have seen, it is, in
many respects, the most interesting. I am told it is
gloomy in winter; but now it was summer. And in
these high latitudes, nature makes ample amends in this
season for the gloom and inclemency of the winter.</p>

<p>The day after delivering my letters, Mr. Y&mdash;&mdash; called
on me, and showed me the lions of the town. Many of
them&mdash;all, indeed&mdash;were interesting; but I pass them by,
and shall only linger a short time at the Court of Sessions,
which is the supreme civil court of Scotland.
This, with the High Court of Justiciary&mdash;the supreme
criminal court&mdash;forms the College of Justice, and constitutes
the supreme tribunal of Scotland. Their sessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
are held in the old Parliament House, situated in the
centre of the Old Town.</p>

<p>We entered a large Gothic hall, opening, as I observed,
into various contiguous apartments. Here I saw a considerable
number of persons, mostly lawyers and their
clients; some sauntering, some meditating, some gathered
in groups and conversing together. There was a large
number of people distributed through the several apartments,
and in the grand hall there was a pervading hum
of voices, which rose and rumbled, and died away amid
the groinings of the roof above.</p>

<p>Among the persons in this hall, a man some thirty
years of age, tall and handsome, dressed in a gown, but
without the wig, attracted my particular attention. He
was walking apart, and there was a certain look of coldness
and haughtiness about him. Nevertheless, for some
undefinable reason, he excited in me a lively curiosity.</p>

<p>"Who is that gentleman?" said I, to my guide.</p>

<p>"That large, noble-looking person, with a gown and
wig? That is Cranstoun, one of our first lawyers, and
the brother-in-law of Dugald Stuart."</p>

<p>"No: that person beyond, and to the left? He is
without a wig."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's Cockburn; a fiery Whig, and one of the
keenest fellows we have at the bar."</p>

<p>"Yes: but I mean that younger person near the
corner."</p>

<p>"Oh, that small, red-faced, freckled man? Why,
that's Moncrief; a very sound lawyer. His father, Sir
Harry Moncrief, is one of the most celebrated divines in
Scotland."</p>

<p>"No, no; it is that tall, handsome, proud-looking
person, walking by himself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I see: that's Lockhart, Sir Walter Scott's son-in-law.
Would you like to know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>And so I was introduced to a man who, at that time,
was hardly less an object of interest to me than Scott
himself. Though a lawyer by profession, he had devoted
himself to literature, and was now in the very height of
his career. Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk, Valerius, and
other works, had given him a prominent rank as a man
of talent; and, besides, in 1820, he had married the
eldest daughter of the "Great Unknown." My conversation
with him was brief at this time, but I afterwards
became well acquainted with him.</p>

<p>My guide now led me into one of the side-rooms,
where I saw a judge and jury, and a lawyer addressing
them. The latter was a very small man, without gown
or wig, apparently about forty years of age, though he
might be somewhat older. He was of dark complexion,
with an eye of intense blackness, and almost painfully-piercing
expression. His motions were quick and
energetic, his voice sharp and penetrating; his general
aspect exciting curiosity rather than affection. He was
speaking energetically, and as we approached the bar my
conductor said to me, in a whisper, "Jeffrey!"</p>

<p>We paused, and listened intently. The case in itself
seemed dry enough: something, I believe, about a <i>stoppage
in transitu</i>. But Jeffrey's pleading was admirable;
clear, progressive, logical. Occasionally, in fixing upon
a weak point of his adversary, he displayed a leopard-like
spring of energy, altogether startling. He seized
upon a certain point in the history of the case, and
insisted that the property in question rested at that period
in the hands of the defendant's agent, for at least a fortnight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
This he claimed to be fatal to his adversary's plea.
Having stated the facts, with a clearness which seemed
to prove them, he said, turning with startling quickness
upon his antagonist,&mdash;"Now, I ask my learned brother
to tell me, what was the state of the soul during that
fortnight?" To a jury of Scotch Presbyterians, familiar
with theological metaphysics, this allusion was exceedingly
pertinent and effective.</p>

<p>We passed into another room. Three full-wigged
judges were seated upon a lofty bench, and beneath them,
at a little table in front, was a large man, bent down and
writing laboriously. As I approached, I caught a side-view
of his face. There was no mistaking him: it was
Sir Walter himself!</p>

<p>Was it not curious to see the most renowned personage
in the three kingdoms sitting at the very feet of these men:
they the court, and he the clerk? They were indeed all
"lords," and their individual names were suggestive to
the ear: one was Robertson, son of the historian of
Charles V.; another was Gillies, brother of the renowned
Grecian scholar of that name; another, Mackenzie, son
of the author of the Man of Feeling. These are high
titles; but what were they to the author of Waverley?</p>

<p>Mr. Y&mdash;&mdash; introduced me to him at once, breaking in
upon his occupation with easy familiarity. As he arose
from his seat, I was surprised at his robust, vigorous
frame. He was very nearly six feet in height, full-chested,
and of a farmer-like aspect. His complexion seemed to
have been originally sandy, but now his hair was grey.
He had the rough, freckled, weather-beaten skin of a man
who is much in the open air; his eye was small and
grey, and peering out keenly and inquisitively from beneath
a heavy brow, edged with something like grey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
twisted bristles: the whole expression of his face, however,
was exceedingly agreeable.</p>

<p>He greeted me kindly, the tone of his voice being
hearty, yet with a very decided Scotch accent. A few
commonplace remarks, and one or two inquiries as to my
acquaintance with American literary men, was all that
passed between us on this occasion; but subsequently, as
will be seen, I was more highly favored.</p>

<p>One morning I found a note at my hotel, from Miss
Y&mdash;&mdash;, inviting me to breakfast. I went at ten, and we
had a pleasant chat. She then proposed a ride, to
which I acceded. She was already in her riding-habit;
so without delay we went forth, calling first upon
Mrs. Russell. She led us into another room, and there,
on the floor, in a romp with her two boys, was Francis
Jeffrey! Think of the first lawyer in Scotland, the lawgiver
of the great republic of letters throughout Christendom,
having a rough-and-tumble on the floor, as if he
were himself a boy! Let others think as they will, I
loved him from that moment; and ever after, as I read
his criticisms, cutting and scorching as they often were,
I fancied that I could still see a kind and genial spirit
shining through them all. At least it is certain that, behind
his editorial causticity, there was in private life a
fund of gentleness and geniality which endeared him to
all who enjoyed his intimacy. I was now introduced to
him, and he seemed a totally different being from the
fierce and fiery gladiator of the legal arena, where I had
before seen him. His manners were gentle and gentlemanly:
polite to the ladies and gracious to me.</p>

<p>We found Mrs. Russell in a riding-dress, and prepared
to accompany us in our excursion. Taking leave of Mr.
Jeffrey, we went to the stable, and having mounted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
walked our steeds gently out of the town by Holyrood,
and to the east of Arthur's seat, leaving Portobello on
the left. We rode steadily, noting a few objects as we
passed, until at last, reaching an elevated mound, we
paused, and the ladies directed my attention to the scenes
around. We were some two miles south of the town,
upon one of the slopes of the Braid Hills. What a view
was before us! The city, a vast smoking hive, to the
north; and to the right, Arthur's Seat, bald and blue,
seeming to rise up and almost peep into its streets and
chimneys. Over and beyond all was the sea. The whole
area between the point where we stood and that vast
azure line, blending with the sky, was a series of abrupt
hills and dimpling valleys, threaded by a network of
highways and byways; honeycombed in spots by cities
and villages, and elsewhere sprinkled with country seats.</p>

<p>It is an unrivalled scene of varied beauty and interest.
The natural site of Edinburgh is remarkable, consisting
of three rocky ledges, steepling over deep ravines.
These have all been modified by art; in one place a lake
has been dried up, and is now covered with roads,
bridges, tenements, gardens, and lawns. The sides of the
cliffs are in some instances covered with masses of buildings,
occasionally rising tier above tier&mdash;in one place presenting
a line of houses a dozen stories in height! The
city is divided by a deep chasm into two distinct parts:
the Old Town, dark and smoky, and justifying the popular
appellation of "Auld Reekie;" the other, the New
Town, with the fresh architecture and the rich and elaborate
embellishments of a modern city. Nearly from the
centre of the Old Town rises the Castle, three hundred
and eighty feet above the level of the sea; on one side
looking down almost perpendicularly, two hundred feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
into the vale beneath; on the other, holding communication
with the streets by means of a winding pathway.
In the new town is Calton Hill, rich with monuments of
art and memorials of history. From these two commanding
positions the views are unrivalled.</p>

<p>But I forget that I have taken you to the Braid Hills.
My amiable guides directed my attention to various objects&mdash;some
far and some near, and all with names
familiar to history, or song, or romance. Yonder mass
of dun and dismal ruins was Craigmillar Castle, once the
residence of Queen Mary. Nearly in the same direction,
and not remote, is the cliff, above whose bosky sides peer
out the massive ruins of Roslin Castle; further south are
glimpses of Dalkieth Palace, the sumptuous seat of the
Duke of Buccleuch; there is the busy little village of
Lasswade, which takes the name of "Gandercleugh" in
the Tales of my Landlord; yonder winds the Esk, and
there the Galawater&mdash;both familiar in many a song; and
there is the scenery of the Gentle Shepherd, presenting
the very spot where that inimitable colloquy took place
between Peggy and her companion Jenny,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gae farer up the burn to Habbie's How<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where a' the sweets o' spring an' summer grow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between twa birks, out o'er a little linn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water fa's and makes a singan din:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pool, breast deep, beneath as clear as glass,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There wash oursels&mdash;it's healthful now in May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' sweetly caller on sae warm a day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While we were surveying these scenes the rain began
to fall in a fine, insinuating mizzle; soon large drops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
pattered through the fog, and at last there was a
drenching shower. I supposed the ladies would seek
some shelter; not they: accustomed to all the humors
of this drizzly climate, and of course defying them. They
pulled off their green veils, and stuffed them into their
saddle-pockets: then chirruping to their steeds, they
sped along the road, as if mounted on broomsticks. I
was soon wet through, and so, doubtless, were they.
However, they took to it as ducks to a pond. On we
went, the water&mdash;accelerated by our speed&mdash;spouting in
torrents from our stirrups. In all my days I had never
such an adventure. And the coolness with which the
ladies took it, that was the most remarkable. Indeed, it
was provoking; for as they would not accept sympathy,
of course they could not give it, though my reeking condition
would have touched any other heart than theirs.
On we went, till at last, coming to the top of the hill, we
suddenly cropped out into the sunshine, the shower still
scudding along the valley beneath us. We continued
our ride, getting once more soaked on our way, and
again drying in the sun. At last we reached home, having
made a circuit of fifteen miles. Scarcely a word was
said of the rain. I saw the ladies to their residences, and
was thankful when I found myself once more in my hotel.</p>

<p>As a just moral of this adventure, I suggest to any
American, who may ride with Scotch ladies around Edinburgh,
not to go forth in his best dress-coat, and pantaloons
without straps.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">BLACKWOOD&mdash;THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY&mdash;SIR WALTER SCOTT&mdash;MR. AND MRS.
LOCKHART&mdash;ORIGIN OF "TAM O'SHANTER"&mdash;LAST WORDS OF SCOTT.</p></blockquote>


<p>I delivered my letter of introduction to Blackwood,
and he treated me very kindly. I found him an exceedingly
intelligent and agreeable gentleman. The Magazine
which bears his name was then in its glory, and of course
a part of its radiance shone on him. He was a man of
excellent judgment in literary matters, and his taste, no
doubt, contributed largely to the success of the Magazine.</p>

<p>Of course I was gratified at receiving from him a note,
inviting me to dine with him the next day. His house
was on the south of the old town, nearly two miles distant.
The persons present were such as I should myself
have selected: among them Lockhart and James Ballantyne.
I sat next the latter, and found him exceedingly
agreeable and gentlemanlike. He was a rather large
man, handsome, smooth in person and manner, and very
well dressed. It must be remembered, that at this time
Scott did not acknowledge that he was the author of the
Waverley novels, nor did his friends. Perhaps the mystery
was even promoted by them; for, no doubt, it added
to the interest excited by his works. However, the veil
was not closely preserved in the circle of intimacy. Ballantyne
said to me, in the course of a conversation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
turned upon the popularity of authors, as indicated by
the sale of their works,&mdash;"We have now in course of
preparation forty thousand volumes of Scott's poems and
the works of the author of Waverley:" evidently intimating
the identity of their authorship.</p>

<p>The next day I went to St. Giles's Church, to see the
General Assembly, then holding its annual session there.
This body consisted of nearly four hundred members,
chosen by different parishes, boroughs, and universities.
The sessions are attended by a Commissioner appointed by
the Crown, but he is seated outside of the area assigned to
the Assembly, and has no vote, and no right of debate.
He sits under a canopy, with the insignia of royalty, and
a train of gaily-dressed pages. He opens the sessions in
the name of the King, the Head of the Church: the
Moderator then opens it in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ, <em>the only true Head of the Church</em>! It appears
that the Scotch, in bargaining for a union with England,
took good care to provide for their religious independence,
and this they still jealously preserve.</p>

<p>The aspect of the Assembly was similar to that of the
House of Commons, though somewhat graver. I observed
that the debates were often stormy, with scraping
of the floor, laughing aloud, and cries of "Hear, hear!"
The members were, in fact, quite disorderly, showing at
least as little regard for decorum as ordinary legislatures.
Sir Walter Scott once remarked, in my hearing, that it
had never yet been decided how many more than six
members could speak at once!</p>

<p>The persons here pointed out to me as celebrities were
Dr. Chalmers, the famous pulpit orator; Dr. Cook, the
ecclesiastical historian; and Dr. Baird, principal of the
University. The first of these was now at the height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
his fame. He had already begun those reforms which,
some years later, resulted in a disruption of the Scottish
Church.</p>

<p>A few days after the dinner at Mr. Blackwood's I dined
with Mr. Lockhart. Besides the host and hostess, there
were present Sir Walter Scott, his son, Charles Scott,
Mr. Blackwood, and three or four other persons. At
dinner I sat next Sir Walter. Everything went off
pleasantly, with the usual ease, hospitality, and heartiness
of an English dinner.</p>

<p>After the ladies had retired the conversation became
general and animated. Byron was the engrossing topic.
Sir Walter spoke of him with the deepest feeling of admiration
and regret. A few weeks before, on the receipt
of the news of his death, he had written an obituary
notice of him, in which he compared him to the sun,
withdrawn from the heavens at the very moment when
every telescope was levelled to discover either his glory
or his spots.</p>

<p>Lockhart and Blackwood both told stories, and we
passed a pleasant half hour. The wine was at last
rather low, and our host ordered the servant to bring
more. Upon which Scott said, "No, no, Lokert"&mdash;such
was his pronunciation of his son-in-law's name&mdash;"we
have had enough: let us go and see the ladies." And
so we gathered to the parlor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lockhart spoke with great interest of Washington
Irving, who had visited the family at Abbotsford.
She said that he slept in a room which looked out on the
Tweed. In the morning, when he came down to breakfast,
he was very pale, and being asked the reason, confessed
that he had not been able to sleep. The sight of
the Tweed from his window, and the consciousness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
being at Abbotsford, so filled his imagination, so excited
his feelings, as to deprive him of slumber.</p>

<p>Our lively hostess was requested to give us some music,
and instantly complied&mdash;the harp being her instrument.
She sang Scotch airs, and played several pibrochs, all
with taste and feeling. Her range of tunes seemed inexhaustible.
Her father sat by, and entered heartily into
the performances. He beat time vigorously with his
lame leg, and frequently helped out a chorus, the heartiness
of his tones making up for some delinquencies in
tune and time. Often he made remarks upon the songs,
and told anecdotes respecting them. When a certain
pibroch had been played, he said it reminded him of the
first time he ever saw Miss Edgeworth. There had come
to Abbotsford a wild Gaelic peasant from the neighborhood
of Staffa, and it was proposed to him to sing a
a pibroch common in that region. He had consented,
but required the whole party present to sit in a circle on
the floor, while he should sing the song, and perform a
certain pantomimic accompaniment, in the centre. All
was accordingly arranged in the great hall, and the performer
had just begun his wild chant, when in walked a
small but stately lady, and announced herself as Miss
Edgeworth!</p>

<p>Mrs. Lockhart asked me about the American Indians,
expressing great curiosity concerning them. I told the
story of one who was tempted to go into the rapids of
the Niagara river, just above the Falls, for a bottle of
rum. This he took with him, and having swam out to the
point agreed upon, he turned back and attempted to regain
the land. For a long time the result was doubtful:
he struggled powerfully, but in vain; inch by inch he receded
from the shore; and at last, finding his doom sealed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
he raised himself above the water, wrenched the cork
from the bottle, and putting the latter to his lips, yielded
to the current, and thus went down to his doom.</p>

<p>Sir Walter then said that he had read an account of
an Indian, who was in a boat, approaching a cataract;
by some accident it was drawn into the current, and the
savage saw that his escape was impossible. Upon this
he arose, wrapped his robe of skins around him, seated
himself erect, and, with an air of imperturbable gravity,
went over the falls.</p>

<p>"The most remarkable thing about the American Indians,"
said Blackwood, "is their being able to follow in
the trail of their enemies, by their footprints left in the
leaves, upon the grass, and even upon the moss of the
rocks. The accounts given of this seem hardly credible."</p>

<p>"I can readily believe it, however," said Sir Walter.
"You must remember that this is a part of their education.
I have learned at Abbotsford to discriminate between
the hoof-marks of all our neighbors' horses, and
I taught the same thing to Mrs. Lockhart. It is, after
all, not so difficult as you might think. Every horse's
foot has some peculiarity, either of size, shoeing, or manner
of striking the earth. I was once walking with
Southey&mdash;a mile or more from home&mdash;across the fields.
At last we came to a bridle-path leading towards Abbotsford,
and here I noticed fresh hoof-prints. Of this I
said nothing; but pausing, and looking up with an
inspired expression, I said to Southey,&mdash;'I have a gift of
second sight: we shall have a stranger to dinner!'</p>

<p>"'And what may be his name?' was the reply.</p>

<p>"'Scott,' said I.</p>

<p>"'Ah, it is some relation of yours,' he said; 'you
have invited him, and you would pass off, as an example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of your Scottish gift of prophecy, a matter previously
agreed upon!'</p>

<p>"'Not at all,' said I. 'I assure you that, till this moment,
I never thought of such a thing.'</p>

<p>"When we got home, I was told that Mr. Scott, a farmer
living some three or four miles distant, and a relative
of mine, was waiting to see me. Southey looked astounded.
The man remained to dinner, and he was asked
if he had given any intimation of his coming. He replied
in the negative: that, indeed, he had no idea of
visiting Abbotsford when he left home. After enjoying
Southey's wonder for some time, I told him that I saw
the tracks of Mr. Scott's horse in the bridle-path, and inferring
that he was going to Abbotsford, easily foresaw
that we should have him to dinner."</p>

<p>Presently the conversation turned upon Burns. Scott
knew him well. He said that Tam O'Shanter was written
to please a stonecutter, who had executed a monument
for the poet's father, on condition that he should write
him a witch-story in verse. He stated that Burns was
accustomed in his correspondence, more especially with
ladies, to write an elaborate letter, and then send a copy
of it to several persons; modifying local and personal
passages to suit each individual. He said that of some
of these letters he had three or four copies, thus addressed
to different persons, and all in the poet's handwriting.</p>

<p>The evening passed in pleasant conversation, varied by
the music of Mrs. Lockhart's voice and harp; and some
amusing imitations by a gentleman of the party, till
twelve o'clock. It will readily be supposed that my eye
often turned upon the chief figure in this interesting
group. I could not for a moment forget his presence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
though nothing could be more unpretending and modest
than his whole air and bearing.</p>

<p>The general effect of his face was that of calm dignity;
and now, in the presence of children and friends, lighted
by genial emotions, it was one of the pleasantest countenances
I have ever seen. When standing or walking,
his manly form, added to an aspect of benevolence, completed
the image; at once exciting affection and commanding
respect.</p>

<p>His manners were quiet, unpretending, absolutely without
self-assertion. He appeared to be happy, and desirous
of making others so. He was the only person present
who seemed unconscious that he was the author of Waverley.
His intercourse with his daughter was most
charming. She seemed quite devoted to him; watching
his lips when he was speaking, and seeking in everything
to anticipate and fulfil his wishes. When she was singing,
his eye dwelt upon her; his ear catching and seeming
to relish every tone. Frequently, when she was
silent, his eye rested upon her, and the lines came to my
mind,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some feelings are to mortals given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With less of earth in them than heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if there be a human tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From passion's dross refined and clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tear so limpid and so meek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would not stain an angel's cheek:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis that which pious fathers shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a duteous daughter's head!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Eight years later, when I was again in London, Scott
was on his death-bed at Abbotsford. Overburdened
with the struggle to extricate himself from the wreck of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
his fortunes, his brain had given way, and the mighty intellect
was in ruins. On the morning of the 17th he
woke from a paralytic slumber; his eye clear and calm,
every trace of delirium having passed away. Lockhart
came to his bedside. "My dear," he said, "I may have
but a moment to speak to you. Be a good man: be virtuous;
be religious: be a good man. Nothing else will
give you any comfort when you are called upon to lie
here!"</p>

<p>These were almost the last words he spoke; he soon
fell into a stupor, which became the sleep of death. So
he died, with all his children around him. "It was a
beautiful day," says his biographer; "so warm, that every
window was wide open; and so perfectly still, that the
sound of all others most delicious to his ear&mdash;the gentle
ripple of the Tweed over its pebbles&mdash;was distinctly audible,
as we knelt around the bed; and his eldest son
kissed and closed his eyes!"</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">EN ROUTE FOR LONDON&mdash;"THE LAIRD O'COCKPEN"&mdash;LOCALITIES OF LEGENDARY
FAME&mdash;DIFFERENCE OF ENGLISH AND AMERICAN SCENERY.</p></blockquote>


<p>Early in June I set out for London. My route led
me through the village of Dalkeith, and the possessions
of the Duke of Buccleuch, which extended for thirty
miles on both sides of the road. We were constantly
meeting objects which revived historical or poetic reminiscences.
Among these was Cockpen, the scene of the
celebrated ballad; and as I rode by the whole romance
passed before my mind. I fancied that I could even
trace the pathway along which the old laird proceeded
upon his courtship, as well as the residence of</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The penniless lass wi' a lang pedigree;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>who was so daft as to reject his offer, although</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His wig was well powthered and as gude as new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His waistcoat was red, and his coat it was blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ring on his finger, a sword and cocked hat&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wha could refuse the laird wi' a' that?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We crossed the Galawater and the Ettrick, and travelled
along the banks of the Tweed. We passed Abbotsford
on our left; and further on saw the Eildon Hills,
"cleft in three" by the wondrous wizard, Michael Scott;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
as duly chronicled in the Lay of the Last Minstrel. We
proceeded along the banks of the Teviot, a small limpid
stream, where barefooted lassies were washing, as in the
days of Allan Ramsay. We saw Netherby Hall, and a
little beyond Cannobie Lea, the scenes of the song Young
Lochinvar. All these, and many more localities of legendary
fame, were passed in the course of a forenoon's
progress in the stage-coach.</p>

<p>One day's journey brought me to Carlisle: thence I
travelled through the lake district, looking with delight
upon Windermere, Rydal, Grassmere, Helvellyn, Derwentwater,
and Skiddaw. Then turning eastward, I
passed over a hilly and picturesque country, to the ancient
and renowned city of York. Having lingered, half
entranced, amid its antiquities, and looked almost with
worship upon its cathedral&mdash;the most beautiful I have
ever seen&mdash;I departed, and soon found myself once more
in London.</p>

<p>As I shall not return to the subject again, I must say a
few words as to the impression England makes upon the
mind of an American traveller. I have visited this country
several times within the last thirty years, and I shall
group my impressions in one general view. The whole
may be summed up in a single sentence, which is, that
England is incomparably the most beautiful country in
the world! I do not speak of it in winter, when encumbered
with fogs; when there is</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No sun, no moon, no morn, no noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No dusk, no dawn&mdash;no proper time of day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sky, no earthly view, no distance looking blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No road, no street, no t'other side the way!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I take her, as I do any other beauty who sits for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
portrait, in her best attire; that is, in summer. The sun
rises here as high in June as it does in America. Vegetation
is just about as far advanced. The meadows, the
wheat-fields, the orchards, the forests are in their glory.
There is one difference, however, between the two countries;
the sun in England is not so hot, the air is not so
highly perfumed, the buzz of the insects is not so intense.
Everything is more tranquil. With us, all nature, during
summer, appears to be in haste: as if its time was short;
as if it feared the coming frost. In England, on the contrary,
there seems to be a confidence in the seasons, as if
there were time for the ripening harvests; as if the
wheat might swell out its fat sides, the hop amplify its
many-plaited flowers, the oats multiply and increase their
tassels; each and all attaining their perfection at leisure.
In the United States, the period of growth of most
vegetables is compressed into ten weeks; in Great
Britain, it extends to sixteen.</p>

<p>If we select the middle of June as a point of comparison,
we shall see that in America there is a spirit,
vigor, energy in the climate, as indicated by vegetable
and animal life, unknown in Europe. The air is clearer,
the landscape is more distinct, the bloom more vivid, the
odors more pungent. A clover-field in America, in full
bloom, is by many shades more ruddy than the same
thing in England: its breath even is sweeter: the music
of the bees stealing its honey is of a higher key. A
summer forest with us is of a livelier green than in any
part of Great Britain; the incense breathed upon the
heart, morning and evening, is, I think, more full and
fragrant. And yet, if we take the summer through, this
season is pleasanter in England than with us. It is
longer, its excitements are more tranquil, and, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
spread over a larger space, the heart has more leisure to
appreciate them, than in the haste and hurry of our
American climate.</p>

<p>There is one fact worthy of notice, which illustrates
this peculiarity of the English summer: the trees there
are all of a more sturdy, or, as we say, <em>stubbed</em> form and
character. The oaks, the elms, the walnuts, beeches, are
shorter and thicker, as well in the trunks as the branches,
than ours. The leaves are thicker, the twigs larger in
circumference. I have noticed particularly the recent
growths of apple-trees, and they are at once shorter and
stouter than in America. This quality in the trees gives
a peculiarity to the landscape: the forest is more solid
and less graceful than ours. If you will look at an English
painting of trees, you notice the fact I state, and
perceive the effect it gives, especially to scenes of which
trees constitute a prevailing element. All over Europe,
in fact, the leaves of the trees have a less feathery appearance
than in America; and in general the forms of
the branches are less arching, and, of course, less beautiful.
Hence it will be perceived that European pictures
of trees differ in this respect from American ones: the
foliage in the former being more solid, and the sweep of
the branches more angular.</p>

<p>But it is in respect to the effects of human art and industry
that the English landscape has the chief advantage
over ours. England is an old country, and shows on its
face the influences of fifteen centuries of cultivation. It
is, with the exception of Belgium, the most thickly-settled
country of Europe.</p>

<p>It is under a garden-like cultivation; the ploughing is
straight and even, as if regulated by machinery; the
boundaries of estates consist, for the most part, of stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
mason-work, the intermediate divisions being hedges,
neatly trimmed, and forming a beautiful contrast to our
stiff stone walls and rail fences. In looking from the top
of a hill over a large extent of country, it is impossible
not to feel a glow of delight at the splendor of the scene:
the richness of the soil, its careful and skilful cultivation,
its green, tidy boundaries chequering the scene, its teeming
crops, its fat herds, its numberless and full-fleeced
sheep.</p>

<p>Nor must the dwellings be overlooked. I pass by the
cities and the manufacturing villages, which, in most
parts, are visible in every extended landscape; sometimes,
as in the region of Manchester, spreading out for miles,
and sending up wreaths of smoke from a thousand tall,
tapering chimneys. I am speaking now of the country;
and here are such residences as are unknown to us. An
English castle would swallow up a dozen of our wood or
brick villas. The adjacent estate often includes a thousand
acres; and these, be it remembered, are kept almost
as much for ornament as use. Think of a dwelling that
might gratify the pride of a prince, surrounded by several
square miles of wooded park, and shaven lawn, and
winding stream, and swelling hill; and all having been
for a hundred, perhaps five hundred years, subjected to
every improvement which the highest art could suggest!
There is certainly a union of unrivalled beauty and magnificence
in the lordly estates of England. We have
nothing in America which at all resembles them.</p>

<p>And then there is every grade of imitation of these
high examples scattered over the whole country. The
greater part of the surface of England belongs to wealthy
proprietors, and these have alike the desire and the
ability to give an aspect of neatness, finish, and elegance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
not only to their dwellings and the immediate grounds,
but to their entire estates. The prevailing standard of
taste thus leads to a universal beautifying of the surface
of the country. Even the cottager feels the influence of
this omnipresent spirit: the brown thatch over his
dwelling, and the hedge before his door, must be neatly
trimmed: the green ivy must clamber up and festoon his
windows; and the little yard in front must bloom with
roses and lilies, and other gentle flowers, in their season.</p>

<p>So much for the common aspect of England as the
traveller passes over it. The seeker after the picturesque
may find abundant gratification in Devonshire, Derbyshire,
Westmoreland, though Wales and Scotland, and
parts of Ireland, are still more renowned for their beauty.
So far as combinations of nature are concerned, nothing
in the world can surpass some of our own scenery; as
along the upper waters of the Housatonic and the Connecticut,
or among the islands of Lake George, and a
thousand other places: but these lack the embellishments
of art and the associations of romance or song, which
belong to the rival beauties of British landscapes.</p>

<p>I confine these remarks to a single topic, the aspect of
England as it meets the eye of an American traveller.
The English do not and cannot enjoy the spectacle as an
American does; for they are born to it, and have no experience
which teaches them to estimate it by common
and inferior standards. Having said so much on this
subject, I shall not venture to speak of English society:
of the lights and shadows of life beneath the myriad
roofs of towns and cities. The subject would be too extensive;
and besides, it has been abundantly treated by
others. I only say, in passing, that the English people
are the best studied at home. John Bull, out of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
house, is generally a rough customer: here, by his fireside,
with wife, children, and friends, he is generous,
genial, gentlemanly. There is no hospitality like that of
an Englishman, when you have crossed his threshold.
Everywhere else he will annoy you. He will poke his
elbow into your sides in a crowded thoroughfare; he will
rebuff you if, sitting at his side in a railway-carriage, you
ask a question by way of provoking a little conversation:
he carries at his back a load of prejudices, like the bundle
of Christian in the Pilgrim's Progress; and, instead of
seeking to get rid of them, he is always striving to increase
his collection. If he becomes a diplomat, his
great business is to meddle in everybody's affairs; if an
editor, he is only happy in proportion as he can say annoying
and irritating things. And yet, catch this same
John Bull at home, and his crusty, crocodile armor falls
off, and he is the very best fellow in the world: liberal,
hearty, sincere,&mdash;the perfection of a gentleman.</p>

<p>London, when I first knew it, was not what it is now.
Its population has at least doubled since 1824. At that
time Charing Cross was a filthy, triangular thoroughfare,
a stand for hackney-coaches, a grand panorama of show-bills
pasted over the surrounding walls, with the King's
Mews in the immediate vicinity: this whole area is now
the site of Trafalgar Square. This is an index of other
and similar changes that have taken place all over the
city. At the present day, London not only surpasses in
its extent, its wealth, its accumulations of all that belongs
to art, the extent of its commerce, the vastness of its influence,
all the cities that now exist, but all that the
world has before known.</p>

<p>King George IV. was then on the throne, and though
he was shy of showing himself in public, I chanced to
see him several times, and once to advantage, at Ascot
Races. For more than an hour his majesty stood in the
pavilion, surrounded by the Duke of Wellington, the
Duke of York, the Marquis of Anglesea, and other
persons of note. But for the star on his left breast, and
the respect paid to him, he might have passed as only an
over-dressed and rather sour old rake. I noticed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
his coat sat very close and smooth, and was told that he
was trussed and braced by stays. It was said to be the
labor of at least two hours to prepare him for a public
exhibition. He was a dandy to the last. The wrinkles
of his coat, after it was on, were cut out by the tailor,
and carefully drawn up with the needle. He had the
gout, and walked badly. I imagine there were few
among the thousands gathered to the spectacle who were
really less happy than his majesty&mdash;the monarch of the
three kingdoms.</p>

<p>I saw the Duke of Wellington not only on this, but on
many subsequent occasions. I think the portraits give a
false idea of his personal appearance. He was really a
rather small, thin, insignificant-looking man, unless you
saw him on horseback. He then seemed rather stately,
and in a military dress, riding always with inimitable
ease, he sustained the image of the great general. At
other times I never could discover in his appearance anything
but the features and aspect of an ordinary, and
certainly not prepossessing, old man. I say this with
great respect for his character, which, as a personification
of solid sense, indomitable purpose, steady loyalty,
and unflinching devotion to a sense of public duty, I conceive
to be one of the finest in British history.</p>

<p>At this period our countryman, Jacob Perkins, was astonishing
London with his steam-gun. He was certainly
a man of extraordinary genius, and was the originator of
numerous useful inventions. At the time of which I
write, he fancied that he had discovered a new mode of
generating steam, by which he was not only to save a
vast amount of fuel, but to obtain a marvellous increase
of power. So confident was he of success, that he told
me he felt certain of being able, in a few months, to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
from London to Liverpool with the steam produced by a
gallon of oil. Such was his fertility of invention, that
while pursuing one discovery others came into his mind,
and, seizing upon his attention, kept him in a whirl of
experiments, in which many things were begun, and
comparatively nothing completed.</p>

<p>Though the steam-gun never reached any practical
result, it was for some time the admiration of London.
I was present at an exhibition of its wonderful performances
in the presence of the Duke of Sussex, the
Duke of Wellington, and other persons of note. The
purpose of the machine was to discharge bullets by steam,
instead of gunpowder, and with great rapidity&mdash;at least
a hundred a minute. The balls were put in a sort of
tunnel, and by working a crank back and forward, they
were let into the chamber of the barrel one by one, and
expelled by the steam. The noise of each explosion was
like that of a musket; and when the discharges were
rapid, there was a ripping uproar, quite shocking to tender
nerves. The balls&mdash;carried about a hundred feet
across the smithy&mdash;struck upon an iron target, and were
flattened to the thickness of a shilling piece.</p>

<p>The whole performance was indeed quite formidable,
and the Duke of Sussex seemed greatly excited. I stood
close to him; and when the bullets flew pretty thick, and
the discharge came to its climax, I heard him say to the
Duke of Wellington, in an under-tone,&mdash;"Wonderful,
wonderful&mdash;wonderful! wonderful, wonderful&mdash;wonderful!
wonderful, wonderful&mdash;wonderful!" and so he went
on, without variation. It was, in fact, a very good commentary
upon the performance.</p>

<p>Having spoken of the Duke of Sussex, I must say a
few words of his brother, the Duke of York, whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
had seen at Ascot. He was there interested in the race,
for he had entered a horse by the name of Moses, for one
of the prizes. Some person reflected upon him for this.
His ready reply was, that he was devoted to <i>Moses and
the profits</i>. Despite his disgrace in the Flanders campaign,
and his notorious profligacy, he was still a favorite
among the British people. There was about him a certain
native honorableness and goodness of heart, which
always existed, even in the midst of his worst career.</p>

<p>I saw the Duke on another occasion, at a cavalry review
on Hounslow Heath. The Duke of Wellington
was among the spectators. He was now in military
dress, and mounted on a fine chestnut-colored horse. His
motions were quick, and frequently seemed to indicate
impatience. Several ladies and gentlemen on horseback
were admitted to the review, and within the circle of the
sentries stationed to exclude the crowd. I obtained admission
by paying five shillings; for I learned that in
England money is quite as mighty as in America. The
privileged group of fair ladies and brave men, gathered
upon a grassy knoll to observe the evolutions of the
soldiers, presented an assemblage such as the aristocracy
of England alone can furnish. Those who imagine that
this is an effeminate generation, should learn that both
the men and women belonging to the British nobility,
taken together, are without doubt the finest race in the
world. One thing is certain, these ladies could stand
fire; for although the horses leaped and pranced at the
discharges of the troops, their fair riders seemed as much
at ease as if upon their own feet. Their horsemanship
was indeed admirable, and suggested those habits of exercise
and training, to which their full rounded forms and
blooming countenances gave ample testimony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>The performances consisted of various marches and
counter-marches&mdash;sometimes slow, and sometimes quick&mdash;across
the extended plain. The evolutions of the flying-artillery
excited universal admiration. When the
whole body&mdash;about four thousand horse&mdash;rushed in a
furious gallop over the ground, the clash of arms, the
thunder of hoofs, the universal shudder of the earth&mdash;all
together created more thrilling emotions in my mind,
than any other military parade I ever beheld. I have
seen eighty thousand infantry in the field; but they did
not impress my imagination as forcibly as these few regiments
of cavalry at Hounslow Heath. One incident gave
painful effect to the spectacle. As the whole body were
sweeping across the field, a single trooper was pitched
from his horse and fell to the ground. A hundred hoofs
passed over him, and trampled him into the sod. On
swept the gallant host, as heedless of their fallen companion
as if only a feather had dropped from of their
caps. The conflict of cavalry in real battle, must be the
most fearful exhibition which the dread drama of war can
furnish. On this occasion both the King and the Duke
of York were present; so that it was one off universal
interest. About fifty ladies on horseback rode back and
forth over the field, on the flanks of the troops, imitating
their evolutions.</p>

<p>I have been often at the House of Commons; but I
shall now only speak of a debate, in July, 1824, upon the
petition, I believe, of the City of London, for a recognition
of the independence of some of the South American
States. Canning was then Secretary of Foreign Affairs,
and took the brunt of the battle made upon the Ministry.
Sir James Mackintosh led, and Brougham followed him,
on the same side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall not attempt to give you a sketch of the
speeches: a mere description of the appearance and
manner of the prominent orators will suffice. Sir James,
then nearly sixty years old, was a man rather above the
ordinary size; and with a fine, philanthropic face. His
accent was decidedly Scotch, and his voice shrill and dry.
He spoke slowly, often hesitated, and was entirely destitute
of what we call eloquence. There was no easy flow of
sentences, no gush of feeling, no apparent attempt to address
the heart or the imagination. His speech was a
rigid lecture, rather abstract and philosophical; evidently
addressed to the stern intellect of stern men. He had
a good deal of gesture, and once or twice was boisterous
in tone and manner. His matter was logical; and
occasionally he illustrated his propositions by historical
facts, happily narrated. On the whole he made the impression
upon my mind that he was a very philosophical,
but not very practical, statesman.</p>

<p>Brougham's face and figure are familiar to every one;
and making allowance for added years, there is little
change in his appearance since the time of which I
speak. He had abundance of words, as well as ideas.
In his speech on the occasion I describe, he piled thought
upon thought, laced sentence within sentence, mingled
satire and philosophy, fact and argument, history and
anecdote, as if he had been a cornucopia, and was
anxious to disburden himself of his abundance. In all
this there were several hard hits, and Canning evidently
felt them. As he rose to reply, I took careful note of his
appearance; for he was then, I imagine, the most conspicuous
of the British Statesmen. He was a handsome
man, with a bald, shining head, and a figure slightly
stooping in the shoulders. His face was round, his eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
large and full, his lips a little voluptuous: the whole bearing
a lively and refined expression. In other respects,
his appearance was not remarkable. His voice was
musical; and he spoke with more ease and fluency than
most other orators of the House of Commons; yet even
he hesitated, paused, and repeated his words, not only in
the beginning, but sometimes in the very midst of his
argument. He, however, riveted the attention of the
Members; and his observations frequently brought out
the ejaculation of "hear, hear," from both sides of the
House. Brougham and Mackintosh watched him with
vigilant attention; now giving nods of assent, and now
signs of disapprobation.</p>

<p>Of course, I visited the House of Lords, paying two
shillings and sixpence for admittance. The general aspect
of the assembly was eminently grave and dignified.
Lord Eldon was the Chancellor&mdash;a large, heavy, iron-looking
man&mdash;the personification of bigoted Conservatism.
He was so opposed to reforms, that he shed tears
when the punishment of death was abolished for stealing
five shillings in a dwelling-house! When I saw him,
his head was covered with the official wig: his face sufficed,
however, to satisfy any one that his obstinacy of
character was innate.</p>

<p>While I was here, a Committee from the House of
Commons was announced; they had brought up a message
to the Lords. The Chancellor, taking the seals in
his hands, approached the Committee, bowing three times,
and they doing the same. Then they separated, each
moving backward, and bowing. To persons used to such
a ceremony, this might be sublime; to me it was ludicrous:
and all the more so, on account of the ponderous
starchness of the chief performer in the solemn farce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
There was a somewhat animated debate while I was
present, in which Lords Liverpool, Lauderdale, Harrowby
and Grey participated; yet nothing was said or done
that would justify particular notice at this late day.</p>

<p>A great event happened in the musical world while I
was in London&mdash;the appearance of Catalani at the Italian
Opera, after several years of absence. The opera was <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Le
Nozze di Figaro</i>. I had never before seen an opera;
and could not, even by the enchantments of music, have
my habits of thought and my common sense so completely
overturned and bewitched, as to see the whole
business of life&mdash;intrigue, courtship, marriage, cursing,
shaving, preaching, praying, loving, hating&mdash;done by
singing, instead of talking, and yet feel that it was all
right and proper. It requires both a musical ear and
early training fully to appreciate and feel the opera.</p>

<p>Madame Catalani was a large handsome woman; a
little masculine and past forty. She was not only a very
clever actress, but was deemed to have every musical
merit&mdash;volume, compass, clearness of tone, surpassing
powers of execution. Her whole style was dramatic;
bending even the music to the sentiments of the character
and the song. I could appreciate, uninstructed as I
was, her amazing powers; though, to say the truth, I
was quite as much astonished as pleased. Pasta and
Garcia, both of whom I afterwards heard, gave me infinitely
greater pleasure; chiefly because their voices possessed
that melody of tone which excites sympathy in
every heart; even the most untutored. Madame Catalani
gave the opera a sort of epic grandeur&mdash;an almost
tragic vehemence of expression; Pasta and Garcia rendered
it the interpreter of those soft and tender emotions,
for the expression of which God seems to have given music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to mankind. It was, no doubt, a great thing to hear
the greatest cantatrice of the age; but I remember Madame
Catalani as a prodigy, rather than as an enchantress.
On the occasion I am describing, she sang, by request,
"Rule Britannia" between the acts; which drew forth
immense applause, in which I heartily joined: not that
I liked the words, but that I felt the music.</p>

<p>It was about this time that a great attraction was announced
at one of the theatres; nothing less than the
King and Queen of the Sandwich Islands, who had graciously
condescended to honor the performance with their
presence. They had come to visit England, and pay their
homage to George the Fourth; hence the Government
deemed it necessary to receive them with hospitality, and
pay them such attentions as were due to their rank and
royal blood. The king's name was Kamehamaha; but
he had also the sub-title or surname of Rhio-Rhio:
which, being interpreted, meant Dog of Dogs. Canning's
wit got the better of his reverence, and so he profanely
suggested that, if his majesty was a Dog of Dogs,
what must the queen be? However, there was an old
man about the court, who had acquired the title of
Poodle, and he was selected as a fit person to attend
upon their majesties. They had their lodgings at the
Adelphi Hotel, and might be seen at all hours of the day,
looking at the puppet-shows in the streets with intense
delight. Of all the institutions of Great Britain, Punch
and Judy evidently made the strongest and most favorable
impression upon the royal party.</p>

<p>They were, I believe, received at a private interview
by the King at Windsor: everything calculated to
gratify them was done. I saw them at the theatre,
dressed in a European costume, with the addition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
some barbarous finery. The king was an enormous man&mdash;six
feet three or four inches; the queen was short, but
otherwise of ample dimensions. Besides these persons,
the party comprised five or six other members of the
king's household. They had all large, round, flat faces,
of a coarse, though good-humored expression. Their
complexion was a ruddy brown, not very unlike the
American Indians; their general aspect, however, was
very different. They looked with a kind of vacant wonder
at the play, evidently not comprehending it; the
farce, on the contrary, seemed greatly to delight them.
It is sad to relate that this amiable couple never returned
to their country; both died in England&mdash;victims either
to the climate, or to the change in their habits of living.</p>

<p>Among the prominent objects of interest in London at
this period was Edward Irving, then preaching at the
Caledonian Chapel, Cross Street, Hatton Garden. He
was now in the full flush of his fame; and such was the
eagerness to hear him, that it was difficult to get admission.
People of all ranks&mdash;literary men, philosophers,
statesmen, noblemen, persons of the highest name and
influence, with a full and diversified representation of the
fair sex&mdash;crowded to his church. I was so fortunate as
to get a seat in the pew of a friend, a privilege which I
appreciated all the more when I counted twenty coroneted
coaches standing at the door, some of those who came in
them not being able to obtain even an entrance into the
building. The interior was crowded to excess; the aisles
were full; and even fine ladies seemed happy to get seats
upon the pulpit stairway. Persons of the highest title
were scattered here and there, and cabinet ministers were
squeezed in with the mass of common humanity.</p>

<p>Mr. Irving's appearance was very remarkable. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
was over six feet in height, very broad-shouldered, with
long, black hair hanging in heavy, twisted ringlets down
upon his shoulders. His complexion was pallid, yet
swarthy; the whole expression of his face, owing chiefly
to an unfortunate squint, was half-sinister and half-sanctified,
creating in the minds of the beholder a painful
doubt whether he was a great saint or a great sinner.</p>

<p>There was a strange mixture of saintliness and dandyism
in the whole appearance of this man. His prayer
was affected&mdash;strange, quaint, peculiar in its phraseology,
yet solemn and striking. His reading of the psalm was
peculiar, and a fancy crossed my mind that I had heard
something like it, but certainly not in a church. I was
seeking to trace out a resemblance between this strange
parson and some star of Drury Lane or Covent Garden.
Suddenly I found the clue: Edward Irving in the pulpit
was imitating Edmund Kean upon the stage! And he
succeeded admirably&mdash;his tall and commanding person
giving him an immense advantage over the little, insignificant,
yet inspired actor. He had the tones of the
latter, his gestures, his looks even, as I had often seen
him in Richard the Third and Shylock. He had evidently
taken lessons of the renowned tragedian, but whether
in public or private is not for me to say.</p>

<p>In spite of the evident affectation, the solemn dandyism,
the dramatic artifices of the performer&mdash;for, after
all, I could only consider the preacher as an actor&mdash;the
sermon was very impressive. The phraseology was rich,
flowing, redundant, abounding in illustration, and seemed
to me carefully modelled after that of Jeremy Taylor.
Some of the pictures presented to the imagination were
startling, and once or twice it seemed as if the whole audience
was heaving and swelling with intense emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
like a sea rolling beneath the impulses of a tempest.
Considered as a display of oratorical art, it was certainly
equal to anything I have ever heard from the pulpit; yet
it did not appear to me calculated to have any permanent
effect in enforcing Christian truth upon the conscience.
The preacher seemed too much a player, and too little an
apostle. The after-thought was, that the whole effect
was the result of stage trick, and not of sober truth.</p>

<p>The character and career of Edward Irving present a
strange series of incongruities. He was born in Scotland
in 1792; he became a preacher, and acquired speedy
notoriety, as much by his peculiarities as his merits. He
attracted the attention of Dr. Chalmers, and through his
influence was for a time assistant-minister in the parish
of St. John's, at Glasgow. From this place he was called
to the Caledonian Chapel, where I heard him. His fame
continued to increase; and having published a volume
of discourses, under the quaint title, For the Oracles of
God, four Orations: for Judgment to come, an Argument
in Nine Parts: three large editions of the work
were sold in the space of six months. Wherever he
preached crowds of eager listeners flocked to hear him.
His eccentricities increased with his fame. He drew out
his discourses to an enormous length, and on several occasions
protracted the services to four hours! He soon
became mystical, and took to studying unfulfilled prophecy
as the true key to the interpretation of the Scriptures.
From this extravagance he passed to the doctrine that
Christians, by the power of faith, can attain to the working
of miracles, and speaking with unknown tongues, as
in the primitive ages. Such at last were his vagaries,
that he was cut off from communion with the Scottish
Church; in consequence, he became the founder of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
sect which continues to the present time in England,
bearing the title of "Irvingites." Worn out with anxiety
and incessant labors, he died at Glasgow, while on a
journey for his health, in 1834, at the early age of forty-two.</p>

<p>One more event I must notice&mdash;the arrival in London
of the remains of Lord Byron, and their lying in state
previous to interment. His body had been preserved in
spirits, and was thus brought from Greece, attended by
five persons of his lordship's suite. Having been transferred
to the coffin, it lay in state at the house of Sir
Edward Knatchbull, where such were the crowds that
rushed to behold the spectacle, that it was necessary to
defend the coffin with a stout wooden railing. When I
arrived at the place the lid was closed. I was told, however,
that the countenance, though the finer lines had
collapsed, was so little changed as to be easily recognised
by his acquaintances. The general muscular form of the
body was perfectly preserved.</p>

<p>The aspect of the scene, even as I witnessed it, was
altogether very impressive. The coffin was covered with
a pall, enriched by escutcheons wrought in gold. On
the top was a lid, set round with black plumes. Upon
it were these words,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center spaced">
"GEORGE GORDON NOEL BYRON.<br />
<span class="smcap">Born in London, 22d January, 1788.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Died at Missolonghi, April 19th, 1824.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>At the head of the coffin was an urn containing the
ashes of his brain and heart: this being also covered
with a rich pall, wrought with figures in gold. The
windows were closed, and the darkened room was feebly
illumined by numerous wax tapers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>And this was all that remained of Byron! What a
lesson upon the pride of genius, the vanity of rank, the
fatuity of fame,&mdash;all levelled in the dust, and, despite the
garnished pall and magnificent coffin, their possessor
bound to pass through the same process of corruption as
the body of a common beggar!</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES&mdash;BOSTON AND ITS WORTHIES&mdash;BUSINESS
OPERATIONS&mdash;ACKERMANN'S "FORGET-ME-NOT" THE PARENT OF ALL
OTHER ANNUALS&mdash;THE AMERICAN SPECIES&mdash;THEIR DECLINE.</p></blockquote>


<p>Having made a hurried excursion to Paris and back
to London, I departed for Liverpool, and thence embarked
for the United States, arriving there in October,
1824. I remained at Hartford till October, 1826, and
then removed to Boston, with the intention of publishing
original works, and at the same time of trying my hand
at authorship&mdash;the latter part of my plan, however,
known only to myself.</p>

<p>At that time Boston was recognized as the literary
metropolis of the Union&mdash;the admitted Athens of America.
Edward Everett had established the North-American
Review, and though he had now just left the editorial
chair, his spirit dwelt in it, and his fame lingered
around it. R. H. Dana, Edward T. Channing, George
Bancroft, and others, were among the rising lights of the
literary horizon. Society was strongly impressed with
literary tastes, and genius was respected and cherished.
The day had not yet come when it was glory enough for
a college professor to marry a hundred thousand dollars
of stocks, or when it was the chief end of a lawyer to
become the attorney of an insurance company, or a bank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
or a manufacturing corporation. A Boston imprint on a
book was equal to a certificate of good paper, good print,
good binding, and good matter. And while such was
the state of things at Boston, at New York the Harpers,
who till recently had been mere printers in Dover street,
had scarcely entered upon their career as publishers; and
the other shining lights in the trade, at the present time,
were either unborn, or in the nursery, or at school.</p>

<p>What a revolution do these simple items suggest,
wrought in the space of thirty years! The sceptre has
departed from Judah: New York is now the acknowledged
metropolis of American literature, as well as of
art and commerce. Nevertheless, if we look at Boston
literature at the present time, as reflected in its publishing
lists, we shall see that the light of other days has not
degenerated; for since the period of which I speak, Prescott,
Longfellow, Hawthorne, Whipple, Holmes, Lowell,
Hilliard, have joined the Boston constellation of letters.</p>

<p>It cannot interest the reader to hear in detail my business
operations in Boston at this period. It will be sufficient
to say that, among other works, I published an
edition of the novels of Charles Brockden Brown, with a
life of the author, furnished by his widow, she having a
share of the edition. I also published an edition of Hannah
More's works, and of Mrs. Opie's works: these being,
I believe, the first complete collections of the writings of
these authors. In 1827 I published Sketches by N. P.
Willis, his first adventure in responsible authorship. The
next year I issued the Commonplace Book of Prose, the
first work of the now celebrated Dr. Cheever. This was
speedily followed by the Commonplace Book of Poetry,
and Studies in Poetry, by the same author.</p>

<p>In 1828 I published a first, and soon after a second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
volume of the Legendary, designed as a periodical, and
intended to consist of original pieces in prose and verse,
principally illustrative of American history, scenery, and
manners. This was edited by N. P. Willis, and was, I
believe, his first editorial engagement. Among the contributors
were Halleck, Miss Sedgwick, Miss Francis, Mrs.
Sigourney, Willis, Pierpont, and other popular writers of
that day. It was kindly treated by the press, which generously
published, without charge, the best pieces in full,
saving the reading million the trouble of buying the book
and paying for the chaff, which was naturally found with
the wheat. Despite this courtesy, the work proved a
miserable failure. The time had not come for such a
publication. At the present day, with the present accessories
and the present public spirit, I doubt not that such
an enterprise would be eminently successful.</p>

<p>The first work of the Annual kind, entitled the Forget-Me-Not,
was issued by the Ackermanns of London, in the
winter of 1823, while I was in that city. It was successfully
imitated by Carey and Lea at Philadelphia, in a
work entitled the Atlantic Souvenir, and which was sustained
with great spirit for several years. In 1828 I
commenced and published the first volume of the Token,
which I continued for fifteen years; editing it myself,
with the exception of the volume for 1829, which came
out under the auspices of Mr. Willis. In 1836, the Atlantic
Souvenir ceased; and after that time, by arrangement
with the publishers, its title was added to that of
the Token.</p>

<p>The success of this species of publication stimulated
new enterprises of the kind, and a rage for them spread
over Europe and America. The efforts of the first artists
and the best writers were at length drawn into them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and for nearly twenty years every autumn produced an
abundant harvest of Diadems, Bijous, Amaranths, Bouquets,
Hyacinths, Amulets, Talismans, Forget-Me-Nots,
&amp;c. Under these seductive titles they became messengers
of love, tokens of friendship, signs and symbols of affection,
and luxury and refinement; and thus they stole
alike into the palace and the cottage, the library, the
parlor, and the boudoir. The public taste grew by feeding
on these luscious gifts, and soon craved even more
gorgeous works of the kind; whence came Heath's Book
of Beauty, Lady Blessington's Flowers of Loveliness,
Bulwer's Pilgrims of the Rhine, Butler's Leaflets of
Memory, Christmas with the Poets, and many others of
similar design and execution. Many of the engravings
of these works cost 500 dollars each, and many a piece
of poetry 50 dollars a page. On several of these works
the public spent 50,000 dollars a-year!</p>

<p>At last the race of Annuals drew near the end of its
career, yet not without having produced a certain revolution
in the public taste. Their existence had sprung, at
least in part, from steel-engraving, which had been invented
and introduced by our countryman, Jacob Perkins.
This enabled the artist to produce works of greater
delicacy than had ever before been achieved; steel also
gave the large number of impressions which the extensive
sales of the Annuals demanded, and which could not
have been obtained from copper. These works scattered
gems of art far and wide, making the reading mass
familiar with fine specimens of engraving; and not only
cultivating an appetite for this species of luxury, but exalting
the general standard of taste all over the civilized
world.</p>

<p>And thus, though the Annuals, by name, have perished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
they have left a strong necessity in the public mind
for books enriched by all the embellishments of art.
Hence we have illustrated editions of Byron, Rogers,
Thomson, Cowper, Campbell, and others; including our
own poets, Bryant, Halleck, Sigourney, Longfellow,
Read, &amp;c. Wood-engraving, which since then has risen
into such importance, has lent its potent aid in making
books one of the chief luxuries of society, from the
nursery to the parlor.</p>

<p>In comparison with many of these works, the Token
was a very modest affair. The first year I offered prizes
for the best pieces in prose and poetry. The highest for
prose was awarded to the author of Some Passages in the
Life of an Old Maid. A mysterious man, in a mysterious
way, presented himself for the money, and, giving due
evidence of his authority to receive it, it was paid to
him; but who the author really was never transpired,
though I had, and still have, my confident guess upon
the subject. Even the subsequent volumes, though they
obtained favor in their day, did not approach the splendor
of the modern works of a similar kind. Nevertheless,
some of the engravings, from the designs of Allston,
Leslie, Newton, Cole, Inman, Chapman, Fisher, Brown,
Alexander, Healy, and others, were very clever, even
compared with the finest works of the present day.</p>

<p>The literary contributions were, I believe, equal, on the
whole, to any of the Annuals, American or European.
Here were inserted some of the earliest productions of
Willis, Hawthorne, Miss Francis (now Mrs. Child), Miss
Sedgwick, Mrs. Hale, Pierpont, Greenwood, and Longfellow.
Several of these authors first made acquaintance
with the public through the pages of this work. It is
a curious fact that the latter, Longfellow, wrote prose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
at that period had shown neither a strong bias nor a
particular talent for poetry.</p>

<p>The Token was continued annually till 1842, when it
finally ceased. The day of Annuals had, indeed, passed
before this was given up; and the last two or three
years it had only lingered out a poor and fading existence.
As a matter of business, it scarcely paid its expenses, and
was a serious drawback upon my time and resources for
fifteen years; a punishment, no doubt, fairly due to an
obstinate pride, which made me reluctant to abandon a
work with which my name and feelings had become somewhat
identified.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">"THE TOKEN"&mdash;N. P. WILLIS AND NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE&mdash;COMPARISON
BETWEEN THEM&mdash;LADY AUTHORS&mdash;PUBLISHERS' PROFITS&mdash;AUTHORS AND
PUBLISHERS.</p></blockquote>


<p>I may here say, with propriety, a few words more as
to the contributors for the Token. The most prominent
writer for it was N. P. Willis; his articles were the most
read, the most admired, the most abused, and the most
advantageous to the work. I published his first book;
and his two first editorial engagements were with me:
hence the early portion of his literary career fell under
my special notice.</p>

<p>He had begun to write verses very early; and while
in College, before he was eighteen, he had acquired an
extended reputation, under the signature of "Roy." In
1827, when he was just twenty years old, I published his
volume, entitled Sketches. It elicited quite a shower of
criticism, in which praise and blame were about equally
dispensed: at the same time the work sold with a readiness
quite unusual for a book of poetry at that period. It
is not calculated to establish the infallibility of critics, to
look over these notices at the present day: many of the
pieces which were then condemned have now taken their
places among the acknowledged gems of our literature;
and others, which excited praise at the time, have faded
from the public remembrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing is certain, everybody thought Willis worth
criticising. He has been, I suspect, more written about
than any other literary man in the history of American
literature. Some of the attacks upon him proceeded, no
doubt, from a conviction that he was a man of extraordinary
gifts, and yet of extraordinary affectations; and the
lash was applied in kindness, as that of a schoolmaster to
a beloved pupil's back; some of them were dictated by
envy; for we have had no other example of literary success
so early, so general, and so flattering. That Mr.
Willis made mistakes in literature and life, at the outset,
may be admitted by his best friends; for it must be remembered
that, before he was five-and-twenty, he was
more read than any other American poet of his time;
and besides, being possessed of an easy and captivating
address, he became the pet of society, and especially of
the fairer portion of it. Since that period, his life, on the
whole, has been one of serious, useful, and successful
labor. His reputation as a poet has hardly advanced,
and probably the public generally regard some of his
early verses as his best. As an essayist, however, he
stands in the first rank; distinguished for a keen sagacity
in analyzing society, a fine perception of the beauties of
nature, and an extraordinary talent for endowing trifles
with interest and meaning. As a traveller, he is among
the most entertaining, sagacious, and instructive.</p>

<p>His style is certainly peculiar, and is deemed affected,
tending to an excess of refinement, and displaying an
undue hankering for grace and melody; sometimes
sacrificing sense to sound. This might once have been a
just criticism, but the candid reader of his works now before
the public will deem it hypercritical. His style is
suited to his thought; it is flexible, graceful, musical, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
is adapted to the playful wit, the piquant sentiment, the
artistic descriptions of sea, earth, and sky, of which they
are the vehicle. In the seeming exhaustlessness of his
resources, in his prolonged freshness, in his constantly-increasing
strength, Mr. Willis has refuted all the early
prophets, who regarded him only as a precocity, destined
to shine a few brief years and fade away.</p>

<p>As to his personal character, I need only say, that
from the beginning he had a larger circle of steadfast
friends than almost any man within my knowledge.
There has been something in his works which has made
women generally both his literary and personal admirers.
For so many favors he has given the world an ample return;
for, with all his imputed literary faults&mdash;some real
and some imaginary&mdash;I regard him as having contributed
more to the amusement of society than almost any other
of our living authors.</p>

<p>It is not easy to conceive of a stronger contrast than
is presented by comparing Nathaniel Hawthorne with
N. P. Willis. The former was for a time one of the principal
writers for the Token, and his admirable sketches
were published side by side with those of the latter.
Yet it is curious to remark, that everything Willis wrote
attracted immediate attention, and excited ready praise,
while the productions of Hawthorne were almost entirely
unnoticed.</p>

<p>The personal appearance and demeanor of these two
gifted young men, at the early period of which I speak,
was also in striking contrast. Willis was slender, his
hair sunny and silken, his cheeks ruddy, his aspect cheerful
and confident. He met society with a ready and
welcome hand, and was received readily and with welcome.
Hawthorne, on the contrary, was of a rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
sturdy form, his hair dark and bushy, his eyes steel-grey,
his brow thick, his mouth sarcastic, his complexion stony,
his whole aspect cold, moody, distrustful. He stood
aloof, and surveyed the world from shy and sheltered
positions.</p>

<p>There was a corresponding difference in the writings
of these two persons. Willis was all sunshine and summer,
the other chill, dark, and wintry; the one was full
of love and hope, the other of doubt and distrust; the
one sought the open daylight&mdash;sunshine, flowers, music&mdash;and
found them everywhere; the other plunged into the
dim caverns of the mind, and studied the grisly spectres
of jealousy, remorse, despair.</p>

<p>I had seen some anonymous publication which seemed
to me to indicate extraordinary powers. I inquired of
the publishers as to the writer, and through them a correspondence
ensued between me and "N. Hawthorne."
This name I considered a disguise, and it was not till
after many letters had passed that I met the author, and
found it to be his true title, representing a very substantial
personage. At this period he was unsettled as to his
views: he had tried his hand in literature, and considered
himself to have met with a fatal rebuff from the reading
world. His mind vacillated between various projects,
verging, I think, toward a mercantile profession. I combated
his despondence, and assured him of triumph, if he
would persevere in a literary career.</p>

<p>He wrote numerous articles, which appeared in the
Token: occasionally an astute critic seemed to see
through them, and to discover the mind that was in
them; but in general they passed without notice. Such
articles as "Sights from a Steeple," "Sketches beneath
an Umbrella," the "Wives of the Dead," the "Prophetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Pictures," now universally acknowledged to be productions
of extraordinary depth, meaning, and power,&mdash;extorted
hardly a word of either praise or blame, while
columns were given to pieces since totally forgotten. I
felt annoyed, almost angry, indeed, at this. I wrote
several articles in the papers, directing attention to these
productions, and finding no echo of my views, I recollect
to have asked John Pickering, a gentleman in whose
critical powers I had great confidence, to read some of
them, and give me his opinion of them. He did as I requested;
his answer was that they displayed a wonderful
beauty of style, with a sort of second-sight, which revealed,
beyond the outward forms of life and being, a
sort of spirit-world, somewhat as a lake reflects the earth
around it and the sky above it; yet he deemed them too
mystical to be popular. He was right, no doubt, at that
period; but, ere long, a large portion of the reading
world obtained a new sense&mdash;how, or where, or whence,
is not easily determined&mdash;which led them to study the
mystical, to dive beneath and beyond the senses. Hawthorne
was, in fact, a kind of Wordsworth in prose: less
kindly, less genial toward mankind, but deeper and more
philosophical. His fate was similar: at first he was
neglected, at last he had worshippers.</p>

<p>In 1837 I recommended Mr. Hawthorne to publish a
volume, comprising his various pieces, which had appeared
in the Token and elsewhere. He consented, but
as I had ceased to be a publisher, it was difficult to find
any one who would undertake to bring out the work. I
applied to the agent of the Stationers' Company, but he
refused; until at last I relinquished my copyrights on
such of the tales as I had published to Mr. Hawthorne,
and joined a friend of his in a bond to indemnify them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
against loss; and thus the work was published by the
Stationers' Company, under the title of Twice-Told
Tales, and for the author's benefit. It was deemed a
failure for more than a year, when a breeze seemed to
rise and fill its sails, and with it the author was carried
on to fame and fortune.</p>

<p>Among the most successful of the writers for the
Token was Miss Francis, now Mrs. Child. I have not
seen her for many years, but I have many pleasant remembrances
of her lively conversation, her saucy wit,
her strong good sense, and her most agreeable person
and presence. To Rev. F. W. P. Greenwood I was indebted
not only for some of the best contributions, but
for excellent counsel and advice in my literary affairs.
He was a man of genius, gentle manners, and apostolic
dignity of life and character.</p>

<p>To Mr. Pierpont I was indebted for encouragement
and sympathy in my whole career, and for some of the
best poems which appeared in the work I am noticing. I
remember once to have met him, and to have asked him
to give me a contribution for the Token. He stopped
and said, reflectingly, "I had a dream not long ago,
which I have thought to put into verse. I will try, and if
I am successful you shall have it." A few days after he
gave me the lines, now in all the gem-books, beginning,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Was it the chime of a tiny bell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That came so sweet to my dreaming ear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the silvery tones of a fairy's shell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That he winds on the beach so mellow and clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the winds and the waves lie together asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon and the fairy are watching the deep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She dispensing her silvery light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he his notes, as silvery quite,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
<span class="i0">While the boatman listens and ships his oar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch the music that comes from the shore?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hark! the notes on my ear that play<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are set to words; as they float, they say,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Passing away, passing away!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Next to Willis, Mrs. Sigourney was my most successful
and liberal contributor: to her I am indebted for a
large part of the success of my editorial labors in the
matter now referred to. To Miss Sedgwick, also, the
Token owes a large share of its credit with the public.
To B. B. Thacher, also among the good and the departed;
to Mrs. Osgood, to John Neale, A. H. Everett, Mr. Longfellow,
H. T. Tuckerman, Epes and John Sargent,
Miss Leslie, J. T. Fields, O. W. Holmes&mdash;to all these,
and to many others, I owe the kind remembrance
which belongs to good deeds, kindly and graciously bestowed.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that in a long career, both as
bookseller and editor, I should have escaped altogether
the annoyances and vexations which naturally attach to
these vocations. The relation of author and publisher is
generally regarded as that of the cat and the dog, both
greedy of the bone, and inherently jealous of each other.
The authors have hitherto written the accounts of the
wrangles between these two parties, and the publishers
have been traditionally gibbeted as a set of mean, mercenary
wretches, coining the heart's blood of genius for
their own selfish profits. Great minds, even in modern
times, have not been above this historical prejudice. The
poet Campbell is said to have been an admirer of Napoleon
because he shot a bookseller.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, speaking from my own experience, I suspect,
if the truth were told, that, even in cases where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
world has been taught to bestow all its sympathy in behalf
of the author, it would appear that while there were
claws on one side there were teeth on the other. My
belief is, that where there have been quarrels there have
generally been mutual provocations. I know of nothing
more vexatious, more wearisome, more calculated to beget
impatience, than the egotisms, the exactions, the
unreasonableness of authors, in cases I have witnessed.
That there may be examples of meanness, stupidity, and
selfishness in publishers, is indisputable. But, in general,
I am satisfied that an author who will do justice to a publisher
will have justice in return.</p>

<p>I could give some curious instances of this. A schoolmaster
came to me once with a marvellously clever grammar;
it was sure to overturn all others. He had figured
out his views in a neat hand, like copper-plate. He estimated
that there were always a million of children at
school who would need his grammar; providing for
books worn out, and a supply for new comers, half-a-million
would be wanted every year. At one cent a copy
for the author&mdash;which he insisted was exceedingly moderate&mdash;this
would produce to him five thousand dollars
a year; but if I would publish the work, he would condescend
to take half that sum annually, during the extent
of the copyright&mdash;twenty-eight years! I declined,
and he seriously believed me a heartless blockhead. He
obtained a publisher at last, but the work never reached
a second edition. Every publisher is laden with similar
experiences.</p>

<p>I once employed a young man to block out some little
books to be published under the nominal authorship of
Solomon Bell: these I remodelled, and one or two volumes
were issued. Some over-astute critic announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
them as veritable <i>Peter Parleys</i>, and they had a sudden
sale. The young man who had assisted me, and who was
under the most solemn obligations to keep the matter
secret, thought he had an opportunity to make his fortune;
so he publicly claimed the authorship, and accused
me of duplicity! The result was that the books fell
dead from that hour; the series was stopped; and his
unprinted manuscripts, for which I had paid him, became
utterly worthless. A portion I burnt, and a portion still
remain amidst the rubbish of other days.</p>

<p>In other instances I was attacked in the papers, editorially
and personally, by individuals who were living upon the
employment I gave them. I was in daily intercourse
with persons of this character, who, while flattering me
to my face, I knew to be hawking at me in print. These
I regarded and treated as trifles at the time; they are
less than trifles now. One thing may be remarked, that,
in general, such difficulties come from poor and unsuccessful
writers. They have been taught that publishers
and booksellers are vampires, and naturally feed upon the
vitals of genius; assuming&mdash;honestly, no doubt&mdash;that
they are of this latter class, they feel no great scruple in
taking vengeance upon those whom they regard as
their natural enemies.</p>

<p>My editorial experience also furnished me with some
amusing anecdotes. An editor of a periodical once sent
me an article for the Token, entitled La Longue-vue; the
pith of the story consisted in a romantic youth's falling
in love with a young lady, two miles off, through a telescope!
I ventured to reject it; and the Token for that
year was duly damned in the columns of the offended
author.</p>

<p>In judging of publishers one thing should be considered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and that is, that two-thirds of the original works
issued by them are unprofitable. An eminent London
publisher once told me, that he calculated that out of
ten publications four involved a positive, and often a
heavy, loss; three barely paid the cost of paper, print,
and advertising; and three paid a profit. Nothing is
more common than for a publisher to pay money to an
author, every farthing of which is lost. Self-preservation,
therefore, compels the publisher to look carefully to his
operations. One thing is certain, he is generally the very
best judge as to the value of a book, in a marketable
point of view: if he rejects it, it is solely because he
thinks it will not pay, not because he despises genius.</p>

<p>Happily, at the present day, the relations between
these two parties&mdash;authors and publishers&mdash;are on a better
footing than in former times. Indeed, a great change
has taken place in the relative positions of the two
classes. Nothing is now more marketable than good
writing, whatever may be its form&mdash;poetry or prose, fact
or fiction, reason or romance. Starving, neglected,
abused genius, is a myth of bygone times. If an author
is poorly paid, it is because he writes poorly. I do not
think, indeed, that authors are adequately paid, for
authorship does not stand on a level with other professions
as to pecuniary recompense, but it is certain that a
clever, industrious, and judicious writer may make his
talent the means of living.</p>

<p>Though I was busily engaged in publishing various
works, I found time to make my long-meditated experiment
in the writing of books for children. The first
attempt was made in 1827, and bore the title of the
Tales of Peter Parley about America. No persons but
my wife and one of my sisters were admitted to the
secret: for, in the first place, I hesitated to believe that I
was qualified to appear before the public as an author;
and, in the next place, nursery literature had not then
acquired the respect in the eyes of the world it now
enjoys. It is since that period that persons of acknowledged
genius&mdash;Scott, Dickens, Lamartine, Mary Howitt,
in Europe; and Todd, Gallaudet, Abbott, Miss Sedgwick,
Mrs. Child, and others, in America&mdash;have stooped to the
composition of books for children and youth.</p>

<p>I published my little book, and let it make its way. It
came before the world untrumpeted, and for some months
seemed not to attract the slightest attention. Suddenly I
began to see notices of it in the papers all over the
country, and in a year from the date of its publication it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
had become a favorite. In 1828 I published the Tales
of Peter Parley about Europe; in 1829, Parley's Winter
Evening Tales; in 1830, Parley's Juvenile Tales,
and Parley's Asia, Africa, Sun, Moon, and Stars. About
this time the public guessed my secret. Mrs. Sarah J.
Hale, to whom I am indebted for many kind offices in my
literary career, first discovered and divulged it; yet I
could have wished she had not done me this questionable
favor. Though the authorship of the Parley books has
been to me a source of some gratification, you will see,
in the sequel, that it has also subjected me to endless
vexations.</p>

<p>I shall not enter into the details of my proceedings at
this busy and absorbed period of my life. I had now
obtained a humble position in literature, and was successful
in such unambitious works as I attempted. I
gave myself up almost wholly for about four years&mdash;that
is, from 1828 to 1832&mdash;to authorship, generally writing
fourteen hours a-day.&mdash;A part of the time I was entirely
unable to read, and could write but little, on account of
the weakness of my eyes. In my larger publications I
employed persons to block out work for me: this was
read to me, and then I put it into style, generally writing
by dictation, my wife being my amanuensis. Thus embarrassed,
I still, by dint of incessant toil, produced five
or six volumes a-year, most of them small, but some of
larger compass.</p>

<p>In the midst of these labors&mdash;that is, in the spring of
1832&mdash;I was suddenly attacked with symptoms which
seemed to indicate a disease of the heart, rapidly advancing
to a fatal termination. In the course of a fortnight
I was so reduced as not to be able to mount a pair
of stairs without help, and a short walk produced palpitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of the heart, so violent, in several instances, as almost
to deprive me of consciousness. There seemed no hope but
in turning my back upon my business, and seeking a total
change of scene and climate. In May I embarked for
England, and after a few weeks reached Paris. I here
applied to Baron Larroque, who, assisted by L'Herminier&mdash;both
eminent in the treatment of diseases of the heart&mdash;subjected
me to various experiments, but without the
slightest advantage. At this period I was obliged to be
carried upstairs, and never ventured to walk or ride alone,
being constantly subject to nervous spasms, which often
brought me to the verge of suffocation.</p>

<p>Despairing of relief here, I proceeded to London, and
was carefully examined by Sir Benjamin Brodie. He
declared that I had no organic disease; that my difficulty
was nervous irritability; and that whereas the French
physicians had interdicted wine, and required me to live
on a light vegetable diet, I must feed well upon good
roast beef, and take two generous glasses of port with
my dinner! Thus encouraged, I passed on to Edinburgh,
where I consulted Abercrombie, then at the height of
his fame. He confirmed the views of Dr. Brodie, in the
main; and, regarding the irregularity of my vital organs
as merely functional, still told me that, without shortening
my life, it would probably never be wholly removed.
He told me of an instance in which a patient of his,
who, having been called upon to testify before the committee
of the House of Commons, in the trial of Warren
Hastings, from mere embarrassment had been seized with
palpitation of the heart, which, however, continued till
his death, many years after. Even this sombre view of
my case was then a relief. Four-and-twenty years have
passed since that period, and thus far my experience has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
verified Dr. Abercombie's prediction. These nervous
attacks pursue me to this day: yet I have become familiar
with them; and, regarding them only as troublesome
visitors, I receive them patiently and bow them out as
gently as I can.</p>

<p>After an absence of six months I returned to Boston,
and, by the advice of my physician, took up my residence
in the country. I built a house at Jamaica Plain, four
miles from the city, and here I continued for more than
twenty years. My health was partially restored, and I
resumed my literary labors, which I continued steadily,
from 1833 to 1850, with a few episodes of lecturing and
legislating, three voyages to Europe, and an extensive
tour to the South. It would be tedious and unprofitable,
were I even to enumerate my various works, produced
from the beginning to the present time. I may sum up
the whole in a single sentence: I am the author and
editor of about one hundred and seventy volumes, and
of these seven millions have been sold!</p>

<p>I have said, that however the authorship of Parley's
Tales has made me many friends, it has also subjected
me to many annoyances. When I was in London, in
1832, I learned that Mr. Tegg, a prominent publisher
there, had commenced the republication of Parley's
Tales. I called upon him, and found that he had one of
them actually in the press. The result of our interview
was a contract, in which I engaged to prepare several of
these works, which he agreed to publish, allowing me a
small consideration. Four of these works I prepared on
the spot, and after my return to America prepared and
forwarded ten others. Some time after, I learned that
the books, or at least a portion of them, had been
published in London, and were very successful. I wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
several letters to Mr. Tegg on the subject, but could get
no reply.</p>

<p>Ten years passed away, and being in pressing need of
all that I might fairly claim as my due, I went to London,
and asked him to render me an account of his proceedings
under the contract. I had previously learned,
on inquiry, that he had indeed published four or five of
the works, as we had agreed, but, taking advantage of
these, which passed readily into extensive circulation, he
proceed to set aside the contract, and to get up a series of
publications upon the model of those I had prepared for
him, giving them in the title-pages the name of Parley, and
passing them off, by every artifice in his power, as the
genuine works of that author. He had thus published
over a dozen volumes, which he was circulating as Peter
Parley's Library. The speculation, as I was told, had
succeeded admirably; and I was assured that many
thousand pounds of profit had been realized thereby.</p>

<p>To my request for an account of his stewardship the
publisher replied, in general terms, that I was misinformed
as to the success of the works in question; that, in
fact, they had been a very indifferent speculation; that
he found the original works were not adapted to his purpose,
and he had consequently got up others; that he
had created, by advertising and other means, an interest
in these works, and had thus greatly benefited the name
and fame of Parley; and, all things considered, he
thought he had done more for me than I had for him:
therefore, in his view, if we considered the account
balanced, we should not be very far from a fair adjustment.</p>

<p>To this answer I made a suitable reply, but without
obtaining the slightest satisfaction. The contract I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
made was a hasty memorandum, and judicially, perhaps,
of no binding effect on him. And besides, I had no
money to expend in litigation. A little reflection satisfied
me that I was totally at his mercy: a fact of which
his calm and collected manner assured me he was even
more conscious than myself. The discussion was not
prolonged. At the second interview he cut the whole
matter short, by saying,&mdash;"Sir, I do not owe you a
farthing: neither justice nor law requires me to pay you
anything. Still, I am an old man, and have seen a good
deal of life, and have learned to consider the feelings of
others as well as my own. I will pay you four hundred
pounds, and we will be quits! If we cannot do this, we
can do nothing." In view of the whole case, this was as
much as I expected, and so I accepted the proposition.
I earnestly remonstrated with him against the enormity
of making me responsible for works I never wrote, but
as to all actual claims on the ground of the contract I
gave him a receipt in full, and we parted.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the annoyances arising
from the falsification of the name of Parley, which I have
just pointed out, have been the only obstacles which
have roughened the current of my literary life. Not
only the faults and imperfections of execution in my
juvenile works&mdash;and no one knows them so well as myself&mdash;have
been urged against them, but the whole theory
on which they are founded has been often and elaborately
impugned.</p>

<p>It is quite true, that when I wrote the first half-dozen
of Parley's Tales I had formed no philosophy upon the
subject: I simply used my experience with children in
addressing them. I followed no models, I put on no
harness of the schools, I pored over no learned examples.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
I imagined myself on the floor with a group of boys and
girls, and I wrote to them as I would have spoken to
them. At a later period I had reflected on the subject,
and embodied in a few simple lines the leading principle
of what seemed to me the true art of teaching children,&mdash;and
that is, to consider that their first ideas are simple
and single, and formed of images of things palpable to
the senses; and hence that these images are to form the
staple of lessons to be communicated to them.</p>

<p>From this commencement I proceeded, and came to
the conclusion that in feeding the mind of children with
facts, we follow the evident philosophy of nature and
Providence; inasmuch as these had created all children
to be ardent lovers of things they could see and hear,
and feel and know. Thus I sought to teach them history,
and biography, and geography, and all in the way in
which nature would teach them,&mdash;that is, by a large use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the senses, and especially by the eye. I selected as subjects
for my books things capable of sensible representation,
such as familiar animals, birds, trees; and of these
I gave pictures, as a starting-point. The first line I wrote
was, "Here I am; my name is Peter Parley;" and before
I went further, gave an engraving representing my
hero, as I wished him to be conceived by my pupils.
Before I began to talk of a lion, I gave a picture of a
lion; my object being, as you will perceive, to have the
child start with a distinct image of what I was about to
give an account of. Thus I secured his interest in the
subject, and thus I was able to lead his understanding
forward in the path of knowledge.</p>

<p>These views, of course, led me in a direction exactly
opposite to the old theories in respect to nursery-books,
in two respects. In the first place, it was thought that
education should, at the very threshold, seek to spiritualize
the mind, and lift it above sensible ideas, and to teach
it to live in the world of imagination. A cow was very
well to give milk, but when she got into a book she must
jump over the moon; a little girl going to see her grandmother
was well enough as a matter of fact, but to be
suited to the purposes of instruction she must end her
career by being eaten up by a wolf. My plan was, in
short, deemed too utilitarian, too materialistic, and hence
it was condemned by many persons, and among them the
larger portion of those who had formed their tastes upon
the old classics, from Homer down to Mother Goose!</p>

<p>This was one objection; another, was that I aimed at
making education easy&mdash;thus bringing up the child in
habits of receiving knowledge only as made into pap, and
of course putting it out of his power to relish and digest
the stronger meat, even when his constitution demanded it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>On these grounds, and still others, my little books met
with opposition, sometimes even in grave Quarterlies, and
often in those sanctified publications, entitled "Journals
of Education." In England, at the period that the name
of Parley was most current&mdash;both in the genuine as well
as the false editions&mdash;the feeling against my juvenile
works was so strong among the conservatives, that an attempt
was made to put them down by reviving the old
nursery-books. In order to do this, a publisher in London
reproduced these works, employing the best artists
to illustrate them, and bringing them out in all the captivating
luxuries of modern typography. Nay, such was
the reverence at the time for the old favorites of the nursery,
that a gentleman of the name of Halliwell expended
a vast amount of patient research and antiquarian lore in
hunting up and setting before the world the history of
these performances, from "Hey diddle diddle" to</p>

<p>To all this I made no direct reply; I ventured, however,
to suggest my views in the following article inserted
in Merry's Museum for August, 1846.</p>

<p>I trust, that no one will gather from this that I condemn
rhymes for children. I know that there is a certain
music in them that delights the ear of childhood. Nor
am I insensible to the fact that in Mother Goose's
Melodies, there is frequently a sort of humor in the odd
jingle of sound and sense. There is, furthermore, in
many of them, an historical significance, which may
please the profound student who puzzles it out; but what
I affirm is, that many of these pieces are coarse, vulgar,
offensive, and it is precisely these portions that are apt to
stick to the minds of children. And besides, if, as is
common, such a book is the first that a child becomes
acquainted with, it is likely to give him a low idea of the
purpose and meaning of books, and to beget a taste for
mere jingles.</p>

<p>With these views, I sought to prepare lessons which
combined the various elements suited to children&mdash;a few
of them even including frequent, repetitious rhymes&mdash;yet
at the same time presenting rational ideas and gentle
kindly sentiments. Will you excuse me for giving you
one example&mdash;my design being to show you how this
may be done, and how even a very unpromising subject
is capable of being thus made attractive to children.</p>

<p>These were my ideas in regard to first books&mdash;toy-books&mdash;those
which are put into the hands of children to
teach them the art of reading. As to books of amusement
and instruction, to follow these, I gave them Parley's
tales of travels, of history, of nature and art, together
with works designed to cultivate a love of truth,
charity, piety, and virtue, and I sought to make these so
attractive as to displace the bad books to which I have
already alluded&mdash;the old monstrosities, Puss in Boots,
Jack the Giant-killer, and others of that class. A principal
part of my machinery was the character of Peter
Parley&mdash;a kind-hearted old man, who had seen much of
the world, and, not presuming to undertake to instruct
older people, loved to sit down and tell his stories to
children. Beyond these juvenile works, I prepared a
graduated series upon the same general plan, reaching up
to books for the adult library.</p>

<p>It is true that occasionally I wrote and published a
book aside from this, my true vocation: thus I edited
the Token, and published two or three volumes of poetry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
But, out of all my works, about a hundred and twenty
are professedly juvenile; and forty are for my early
readers advanced to maturity. It is true that I have
written openly, avowedly, to attract and to please children;
yet it has been my design at the same time to enlarge
the circle of knowledge, to invigorate the understanding,
to strengthen the moral nerve, to purify and
exalt the imagination. Such have been my aims: how
far I have succeeded, I must leave to the judgment of
others. One thing I may perhaps claim, and that is, my
example and my success have led others, of higher gifts
than my own, to enter the ample and noble field of juvenile
instruction by means of books; many of them have
no doubt surpassed me, and others will still follow surpassing
them. I look upon the art of writing for children
and youth, advanced as it has been of late years,
still as but just begun.</p>

HUMILIATION&mdash;THE MICE EAT MY PAPERS&mdash;A WRONG CALCULATION.</p></blockquote>


<p>If thus I met with opposition, I had also my success,
nay, I must say, my triumphs. My first patrons were
the children themselves, then the mothers, and then, of
course, the fathers. In the early part of the year 1846
I made a trip from Boston to the South, returning by the
way of the Mississippi and the Ohio. I received many a
kind welcome under the name of the fictitious hero whom
I had made to tell my stories. Sometimes, it is true, I
underwent rather sharp cross-questioning, and frequently
was made to feel that I held my honors by a rather
questionable title. I, who had undertaken to teach
truth, was forced to confess that fiction lay at the foundation
of my scheme! My innocent young readers, however,
did not suspect me: they had taken all I had said
as positively true, and I was, of course, Peter Parley
himself.</p>

<p>"Did you really write that book about Africa?" said
a black-eyed, dark-haired girl of some eight years old, at
Mobile.</p>

<p>I replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"And did you really get into prison there!"</p>

<p>"No; I was never in Africa."</p>

<p>"Never in Africa?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Well, then, why did you say you had been there?"</p>

<p>On another occasion&mdash;I think at Savannah&mdash;a gentleman
called upon me, introducing his two grandchildren,
who were anxious to see Peter Parley. The girl rushed
up to me, and kissed me at once. We were immediately
the best friends in the world. The boy, on the contrary,
held himself aloof, and ran his eye over me, up and
down, from top to toe. He then walked round, surveying
me with the most scrutinizing gaze. After this he
sat down, and during the interview took no further notice
of me. At parting he gave me a keen look, but said
nothing. The next day the gentleman called and told
me that his grandson, as they were on their way home,
said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grandfather, I wouldn't have anything to do with
that man; he ain't Peter Parley."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" said the grandfather.</p>

<p>"Because," said the boy, "he hasn't got his foot bound
up, and he don't walk with a crutch!"</p>

<p>On my arrival at New Orleans I was kindly received,
and had the honors of a public welcome. The proceedings
were gratifying to me; and, even if they stood
alone, would make amends for much misunderstanding
and opposition.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have spoken chiefly of the books I have
written for children, the design of which was as much to
amuse as to instruct them. These comprise the entire
series called Parley's Tales, with many others, bearing
Parley's name. As to works for education&mdash;school-books,
including readers, histories, geographies, &amp;c.,
books for popular reading, and a wilderness of prose and
poetry admitting of no classification&mdash;it is unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
to recount them. This is the closing chapter of my
literary history, and I have little indeed to say, and that
is a confession.</p>

<p>In looking at the long list of my publications, in reflecting
upon the large numbers that have been sold, I
feel far more of humiliation than of triumph. If I have
sometimes taken to heart the soothing flatteries of the
public, it has ever been speedily succeeded by the conviction
that my life has been, on the whole, a series of
mistakes, and especially in that portion of it which has
been devoted to authorship. I have written too much,
and have done nothing really well. I know, better than
any one can tell me, that there is nothing in this long
catalogue that will give me a permanent place in literature.
A few things may struggle upon the surface for a
time, but&mdash;like the last leaves of a tree in autumn, forced
at length to quit their hold and drop into the stream&mdash;even
these will disappear, and my name and all I have
done will be forgotten.</p>

<p>A recent event, half-ludicrous and half-melancholy, has
led me into this train of reflection. On going to Europe
in 1851 I sent my books and papers to a friend, to be
kept till my return. Among them was a large box of
business documents&mdash;letters, accounts, receipts, bills paid,
notes liquidated&mdash;comprising the transactions of several
years, long since passed away. Shortly after my return
to New York, in preparing to establish myself and
family, I caused these things to be sent to me. On opening
the particular box just mentioned, I found it a complete
mass of shavings, shreds, fragments. My friend
had put it carefully away in the upper loft of his barn,
and there it became converted into a universal mouse-nest!
The history of whole generations of the mischievous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
little rogues was still visible; beds, galleries,
play-grounds, birth-places, and even graves, were in a
state of excellent preservation. Several wasted and
shrivelled forms of various sizes&mdash;the limbs curled up, the
eyes extinct, the teeth disclosed, the long, slender tails
straight and stiffened&mdash;testified to the joys and sorrows of
the races that had flourished there.</p>

<p>On exploring this mass of ruins, I discovered here and
there a file of letters eaten through, the hollow cavity
evidently having been the happy and innocent cradle of
childhood to these destroyers. Sometimes I found a bed
lined with paid bills, and sometimes the pathway of a
gallery paved with liquidated accounts. What a mass of
thoughts, of feelings, cares, anxieties, were thus made the
plunder of these thoughtless creatures! In examining
the papers I found, for instance, letters from N. P.
Willis, written five-and-twenty years ago, with only
"Dear Sir" at the beginning, and "Yours truly" at the
end. I found epistles of nearly equal antiquity from
many other friends&mdash;sometimes only the heart eaten out,
and sometimes the whole body gone.</p>

<p>For all purposes of record, these papers were destroyed.
I was alone, for my family had not yet returned from
Europe: it was the beginning of November, and I began
to light my fire with these relics. For two whole days I
pored over them, buried in the reflections which the reading
of the fragments suggested. Absorbed in this dreary
occupation, I forgot the world without, and was only conscious
of bygone scenes which came up in review before
me. It was as if I had been in the tomb, and was
reckoning with the past. How little was there in all that
I was thus called to remember, save of care, and struggle,
and anxiety; and how were all the thoughts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
feelings, and experiences, which seemed mountains in
their day, levelled down to the merest grains of dust! A
note of hand&mdash;perchance of a thousand dollars&mdash;what a
history rose up in recollection as I looked over its
scarcely legible fragments!&mdash;what clouds of anxiety had
its approaching day of maturity cast over my mind!
How had I been, with a trembling heart, to some bank-president&mdash;he
a god, and I a craven worshipper&mdash;making
my offering of some other note for a discount, which
might deliver me from the wrath to come! With what
anxiety have I watched the lips of the oracle, for my
fate was in his hands! A simple monosyllable&mdash;yes or
no&mdash;might save or ruin me. What a history was in that
bit of paper!&mdash;and yet it was destined only to serve as
stuffing for the beds of vermin.</p>

<p>I ought, no doubt, to have smiled at all this; but I
confess it made me serious. Nor was it the most humiliating
part of my reflections. I have been too familiar with
care, conflict, disappointment, to mourn over them very
deeply, now that they were passed. The seeming fatuity
of such a mass of labors as these papers indicated, compared
with their poor results, however it might humble,
could not distress me. But there were many things
suggested by these letters, all in rags as they were, that
caused positive humiliation. They revived in my mind
the vexations, misunderstandings, controversies of other
days; and now, reviewed in the calm light of time, I
could discover the mistakes of judgment, of temper, of
policy, that I had made. I turned back to my letter-book;
I reviewed my correspondence; and I came to
the conclusion that in almost every difficulty which had
arisen in my path, even if others were wrong, I was not
altogether right: in most cases, prudence, conciliation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
condescension, might have averted these evils. Thus the
thorns which had wounded me and others too, as it
seemed, had generally sprung up from the seeds I had
sown, or had thriven upon the culture my own hands had
unwisely bestowed.</p>

<p>At first I felt disturbed at the ruin which had been
wrought in these files of papers. Hesitating and doubtful,
I consigned them one by one to the flames. At last
the work was complete; all had perished, and the
feathery ashes had leaped up in the strong draught of the
chimney and disappeared for ever. I felt a relief at last;
I smiled at what had happened; I warmed my chill fingers
over the embers; I felt that a load was off my
shoulders. "At least," said I in my heart, "these things
are now passed; my reckoning is completed, the account
is balanced, the responsibilities of those bygone days are
liquidated; let me burden my bosom with them no
more!" Alas, how fallacious my calculation! A few
months only had passed, when I was called to contend
with a formidable claim which came up from the midst
of transactions to which these extinct papers referred,
and against which they constituted my defence. As it
chanced, I was able to meet and repel it by documents
which survived; but the event caused me deep reflection.
I could not but remark that, however we may seek to
cover our lives with forgetfulness, their records still exist,
and these may come up against us when we have no
vouchers to meet the charges which are thus presented.
Who, then, will be our helper?</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">MAKE A SPEECH&mdash;LECTURE ON IRELAND&mdash;POLITICS&mdash;PERSONAL ATTACKS&mdash;BECOME
A SENATOR&mdash;THE "FIFTEEN-GALLON LAW"&mdash;A PAMPHLET IN ITS
FAVOR&mdash;"MY NEIGHBOR SMITH"&mdash;A POLITICAL CAREER UNPROFITABLE.</p></blockquote>


<p>The first public speech I ever made was at St. Albans,
in England, in the year 1832, at a grand celebration of
the passing of the Reform Bill; having accompanied
thither Sir Francis Vincent, the representative in Parliament
of that ancient borough. More than three thousand
people, men, women, and children, gathered from the
town and the vicinity, were feasted at a long table, set
out in the principal street of the place. After this feast
there were various sports, such as donkey-races, climbing
a greased pole, and the like. At six o'clock, about one
hundred and fifty of the gentry and leading tradesmen
and mechanics sat down to a dinner, Sir Francis presiding.
The President of the United States was toasted,
and I was called upon to respond. Entirely taken by
surprise, for not a word had been said to me upon the
subject, I made a speech. I could never recall what I
said: all I remember is a whirl of thoughts and emotions
as I rose, occasional cries of "Hear, hear!" as I went on,
and a generous clapping of hands as I concluded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Whether this last was because I really made a good hit,
or from another principle&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"The best of Graham's speeches was <em>his last</em>"&mdash;</p>

<p>I am totally unable to say.</p>

<p>My next public appearance was in a lecture at the Tremont
Temple, in Boston; my subject being "Ireland and
the Irish." Although my discourse was written, and
pretty well committed to memory, yet for several days
before the time appointed for its delivery arrived, when I
thought of my engagement, my heart failed me. When
the hour came I went to the door of the room, but on
seeing the throng of persons collected I felt that my
senses were deserting me: turning on my heel, I went
out, and going to an apothecary's, fortified myself with
some peppermint lozenges. When I got back, the house
was waiting with impatience. I was immediately introduced
to the audience by Dr. Walter Channing, and stepping
upon the platform, began. After the first sentence, I
was perfectly at my ease. I afterwards delivered this
lecture more than forty times.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1836 there was a large evening
party at Jamaica Plain, at the house of Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;, the
lady-patroness of the village. Among the notable men
present was Daniel Webster, whom I had frequently seen,
but to whom I was now introduced for the first time. He
spoke to me of many things, and at last of politics, suggesting
that the impending presidential election involved
most important questions, and he deemed it the duty of
every man to reflect upon the subject, and to exert his
influence as his conscience might dictate.</p>

<p>Since my residence in Massachusetts, a period of nearly
eight years, I had been engrossed in my business, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
had never even voted. Just at this time I was appointed,
without any suggestion of my own, one of the delegates
to the Whig Convention to nominate a person to represent
us, the Ninth Congressional District, in Congress.
This was to take place at Medway, at the upper end of
the district. I went accordingly, and on the first ballot
was the highest candidate, save one&mdash;Mr. Hastings, of
Mendon. I declined, of course, and he was unanimously
nominated.</p>

<p>The canvass that ensued was a very animated one, Mr.
Van Buren being the democratic candidate for the presidency.
He was considered as the heir-apparent of the
policy of Gen. Jackson, and had, indeed, promised, if
elected, to walk in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor.
Without the personal popularity of that remarkable
man, he became the target for all the hostility which
his measures had excited. He was, however, elected, but
to be overwhelmed with a whirlwind of discontent and
opposition four years after.</p>

<p>The candidate for Congress in our district, in opposition
to Mr. Hastings, was Alexander H. Everett, who had
been hitherto a conspicuous Whig, and who had signalized
himself by the ability and bitterness of his attacks on
General Jackson and his administration. He had singled
out Mr. Van Buren, for especial vehemence of reproach,
because, being Secretary of State at the time, Mr. Everett
was superseded as Minister to Spain without the customary
courtesy of an official note advising him of the
appointment of his successor. To the amazement of the
public in general, and his friends in particular, on the 8th
of January, 1836, Mr. Everett delivered an oration before
the democracy of Salem, in which&mdash;ignoring the
most prominent portion of his political life&mdash;he came out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
with the warmest eulogies upon General Jackson and his
administration! About the first of May, the precise
period when it was necessary, in order to render him
eligible to Congress in the Ninth District, he took up his
residence within its precincts, and, as was easily foreseen,
was the democratic candidate for Congress.</p>

<p>The Whig District Committee, of which I was one,
and Charles Bowen (Mr. Everett's publisher), another,
issued a pamphlet, collating and contrasting Mr. Everett's
two opinions of General Jackson's policy, and especially
of Mr. Van Buren&mdash;the one flatly contradicting the other,
and, in point of date, being but two or three years apart.
This was circulated over the towns of the district. It
was a terrible document, and Mr. Everett felt its force.
One of them was left at his own door in the general distribution.
This he took as a personal insult, and meeting
Bowen, knocked him over the head with his umbrella.
Bowen clutched him by the throat, and would
have strangled him but for the timely interference of a
bystander.</p>

<p>I had been among Mr. Everett's personal friends, but
he now made me the object of special attack. In a paper,
which then circulated a good deal in the district, I was
severely lashed under the name of Peter Parley, not because
I was a candidate for office, but because I was
chairman of the Whig District Committee. I recollect
that one day some rather scandalous thing came out
against me in the editorial columns of this journal, and
feeling very indignant, I went to see the editor. I did
not know him personally, but from occasionally reading
his paper I had got the idea that he was a very monster
of violence. He was not at the office, but such was my
irritation and impatience that I went to his house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>. I
rang, and a beautiful black-eyed girl, some eight years
old, came to the door. I asked if Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; was in?
"Mother," said the child, in a voice of silver, "is father
at home?" At this moment another child, and still
younger, its bullet-pate head all over curls, came to the
door. Then a mild and handsome woman came, and to
my inquiry she said that her husband was out, but would
return in a few moments.</p>

<p>My rage was quelled in an instant. "So," said I to
myself, "these children call that man father, and this
woman calls him husband. After all, he cannot be such
a monster as I have fancied him, with such a home." I
turned on my heel and went away, my ill-humor having
totally subsided. Some two years after I told him this
anecdote, and we had a good-humored laugh over it.
Both of us had learned to discriminate between political
controversy and personal animosity.</p>

<p>The attacks made upon me during this canvass had an
effect different from what was intended. I was compelled
to take an active part in the election, and deeming the
success of my party essential to my own defence, I
naturally made more vigorous efforts for that object.
Mr. Everett was defeated by a large majority, and the
Whig candidate triumphed. At the same time I was
chosen a member of the legislature for Roxbury-Jamaica
Plain, where I resided, being a parish of that
town. The next year I was a candidate for the Senate,
in competition with Mr. Everett, and was elected. In
this manner I was forced into politics, and was indebted
mainly to opposition for my success.</p>

<p>During the ensuing session of the legislature, the
winter of 1837-8, the famous "Fifteen-Gallon Law" was
passed&mdash;that is, a law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
liquors in less quantities than fifteen gallons. The
county I represented was largely in favor of the measure,
and I voted for it, though I was by no means insensible
to the agitation it was certain to produce. I had determined
not to be a candidate for re-election, and therefore
considered myself free to engage in the discussion
which preceded the next election, and which, of course,
mainly turned upon this law. Among other things, I
wrote a little pamphlet, entitled Five Letters to my
Neighbor Smith, touching the Fifteen-Gallon Jug, the
main design of which was to persuade the people of
Massachusetts to make the experiment, and see whether
such a restraint upon the sale of intoxicating drinks
would not be beneficial. This was published anonymously,
and my intention was to have the authorship remain
unknown. It, however, had an enormous sale&mdash;a
hundred thousand copies&mdash;in the course of a few months,
and curiosity soon found me out.</p>

<p>Now in the village of Jamaica Plain I had a neighbor,
though not by the name of Smith&mdash;a rich liquor-dealer,
who did his business in Boston&mdash;a very respectable man,
but a vehement opposer of the "Fifteen-Gallon Law."
As the election approached, the citizens of the state were
drawn out in two parties&mdash;those in favor of prohibition
on the one side, and the men in favor of free liquor on
the other. My neighbor was the wealthiest, the most
respectable, and the most influential of the latter. He
insisted, that by "My Neighbor Smith" I meant him;
and though I had said nothing disagreeable of that personage,
but on the contrary, had drawn his portrait in
very amiable colors, he held that it was a malicious
personal attack. In vain did I deny the charge, and
point to the fact that the residence, character, and qualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of my fictitious hero were inapplicable to him.
Anxious to be persecuted, he insisted upon it that he was
persecuted.</p>

<p>At the county convention, which took place some two
months prior to this election, I declined being a candidate.
The members present, however, clearly discerning
the gathering storm, refused to release me, and I was
forced to accept the nomination. The election was to
take place on Monday, in November. On the Saturday
previous there was issued in Boston a pamphlet, entitled
the Cracked Jug, a personal and political attack upon
me, written with great malice and some ability. It was
scattered, like snow-flakes, all over the country; and
was, I suspect, the Sunday reading of all the tipplers and
taverners of the country. The bar-room critics esteemed
it superior to anything which had appeared since the
Letters of Junius, and, of course, considered me annihilated.</p>

<p>On Monday, election-day, my family were insulted in
the streets of Jamaica Plain, and as I went into the Town
Hall to cast my vote I heard abundance of gibes cast at
me from beneath lowering beavers. The result was, that
there was no choice of senators in the county. The
election, when the people had thus failed to fill their
places, fell upon the legislature, and I was chosen. The
storm gradually passed away. The "Fifteen-Gallon
Law" was repealed, but it nearly overturned the Whig
party in the state, which, being in the majority, was
made responsible for it. I deemed it necessary to reply
to my Neighbor Smith's Cracked Jug, and he rejoined.
What seemed at the time a deadly personal struggle,
was, ere long, forgotten; neither party, I believe, carrying,
in his character or his feelings, any of the scars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
inflicted during the battle. Both had, in some sort, triumphed;
both, in some sort, been beaten; both could,
therefore, afford to return to the amicable relations of
village neighborhood.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1840 the Whigs nominated William
Henry Harrison as the candidate for the presidency, in
opposition to Mr. Van Buren. He had held various civil
and military trusts, in which he had displayed courage,
wisdom, and patriotism. His personal character was
eminently winning to the people, being marked with
benevolence and simplicity. He had long retired from
public life, and for several years had lived as a farmer on
the "North Bend" of the Ohio, near Cincinnati. The
Democrats ridiculed him as drinking hard cider and
living in a log cabin. The masses, resenting this as
coming from those who, having the Government spoils,
were rioting in the White House on champagne, took
these gibes, and displayed them as their mottoes and
symbols upon their banners. They gathered in barns, as
was meet for the friends of the farmer of North Bend,
using songs and speeches as flails, threshing his enemies
with a will. The spirit spread over mountain and valley,
and in every part of the country men were seen leaving
their customary employments to assemble in multitudinous
conventions. Many of these gatherings numbered
twenty thousand persons.</p>

<p>During this animated canvass I was not a candidate for
office, yet I took part in the great movement, and made
about a hundred speeches in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
Everybody, then, could make a speech, and
everybody could sing a song. Orators sprang up like
mushrooms, and the gift of tongues was not more universal
than the gift of music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>From this period I have taken no active part in politics.
In reviewing the past, while duly appreciating the honor
conferred by the confidence bestowed upon me by the
citizens who gave me their suffrages, I still regard my
political career as an unprofitable, nay, an unhappy
episode, alien to my literary position and pursuits, and
every way injurious to my interests and my peace of
mind. It gave me painful glimpses into the littleness, the
selfishness, the utter quackery of a large portion of those
politicians who lead, or seem to lead, the van of parties;
and who, pretending to be guided by patriotism, are
usually only using principles and platforms as means to
carry them into office. As some compensation for this,
it has also led me to a conviction that the great mass of
the people are governed by patriotic motives, though even
with these I have often noted curious instances in which
the public interests were forgotten in a desire to achieve
some selfish end.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">AN APPOINTED U.S. CONSUL TO PARIS&mdash;LOUIS XVIII.&mdash;A FEW JOTTINGS UPON
FRENCH NOTABILITIES&mdash;CURE FOR HYDROCEPHALUS&mdash;UNSETTLED STATE
OF THINGS IN PARIS.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the autumn of 1846, I went with my family to
Paris, partly for literary purposes, and partly also to give
my children advantages of education, which, in consequence
of my absorbing cares for a series of years, they
had been denied. Here they remained for nearly two
years, while I returned home to attend to my affairs,
spending the winters, however, with them.</p>

<p>Toward the close of 1849 I removed to New York, to
execute certain literary engagements. These completed,
I went, in December 1850, to Washington, taking my
family with me. Here we remained for three months,
when, having received the appointment of United States
Consul to Paris, I returned to New York, and, after due
preparation, sailed on the 5th of April, 1851, to enter
upon the official duties which thus devolved upon me.</p>

<p>About the middle of April, 1851, I arrived in Paris,
and soon after took charge of the Consulate there. I
have frequently been in this gay city, and I now propose
to gather up my recollections of it, and select therefrom
a few items which may fill up the blank that yet remains
in my story.</p>

<p>I first visited Paris in January, 1824, as I have told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
you. At the time I first arrived here, this city was very
different from what it now is. Louis XVIII. was upon
the throne, and had occupied it for nine years. During
this period he had done almost nothing to repair the
state of waste and dilapidation in which the Allies had
left it. These had taken down the statue of Napoleon
on the column of the Place Vendôme, and left its
pedestal vacant; the king had followed up the reform
and erased the offensive name of the exiled Emperor from
the public monuments, and put his own, Louis XVIII.,
in their place; he had caused a few churches to be
repaired, and some pictures of the Virgin to be painted
and placed in their niches. But ghastly mounds of rubbish,
the wrecks of demolished edifices; scattered heaps
of stones at the foot of half-built walls of buildings,&mdash;destined
never to be completed,&mdash;these and other unsightly
objects were visible on every hand, marking the
recent history of Napoleon, overthrown in the midst of
his mighty projects, and leaving his name and his works
to be desecrated alike by a foreign foe and a more bitter
domestic adversary.</p>

<p>The king, Louis XVIII., was a man of good sense and
liberal mind, for one of his race; but he was wholly
unfit to administer the government. He was a sort of
monster of obesity, and, at the time I speak of, having
lost the use of his lower limbs, he could not walk, and
was trundled about the palace of the Tuileries in a wheelchair.
I have often seen him let down in this, through
the arch in the south-eastern angle of the palace, into
his coach; and on returning from his ride, again taken
up; and all this more like a helpless barrel of beef than
a sovereign. Had the Allies intended to make Legitimacy
at once odious and ridiculous, they could not better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
have contrived it than by squatting down this obese
imbecile extinguisher upon the throne of France, as the
successor of Napoleon!</p>

<p>The Parisians are, however, a philosophic race: as
they could not help themselves, they did not spend their
lives like children, in profitless poutings. They had their
jokes, and among these, they were accustomed to call
Louis Dix-huit, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louis des huîtres</i>"&mdash;a tolerable pun,
which was equivalent to giving him the familiar title of
"Oyster Louis." Deeming it their birthright to have
three or four hours of pleasure every day, whoever may
be in power, they still frequented the promenades, the
boulevards, and the theatres.</p>

<p>I cannot, perhaps, do better than transcribe a few
passages from the hasty jottings I made at the time:&mdash;</p>

<p>"February 14.&mdash;Went to a meeting of the Société
Philomatique, composed of members of the Institute;
saw Fourier, the famous geometrician and physician:
Thénard, a famous chemist, associated with Gay-Lussac:
Poisson, one of the first mathematicians in Europe; and
Géoffroy St. Hilaire, a zoologist, second only to Cuvier.</p>

<p>"The proceedings were conducted with order and
simplicity, forming a striking contrast to the pompous
declamation I heard in London, at the Society of Arts,
upon hatching eggs.</p>

<p>"February 16.&mdash;Went to a meeting of the Institute,
held in the Hôtel Mazarin: one hundred and fifty members
present; Arago president. He is tall, broad-shouldered,
and imposing in appearance, with a dark, swarthy
complexion, and a black, piercing eye. Lamarck, the
famous writer on natural history&mdash;old, infirm, blind&mdash;was
led in by another member, a distinguished entomologist,
whose name I have forgotten: Fontaine, the architect;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
tall, homely, and aged: Gay-Lussac, a renowned
chemist, under forty, active, fiery in debate: Cuvier,
rather a large man, red face, eyes small, very near-sighted;
eyes near together and oddly appearing and disappearing;
features acute, hair grey, long, and careless:
he spoke several times, and with great pertinency
and effect; Lacroix, the mathematician: Laplace, the
most famous living astronomer; tall, thin, and sharp-featured&mdash;reminded
me of the portraits of Voltaire; he
is about seventy-five, feeble, yet has all his mental
faculties.</p>

<p>"The principal discussion related to gasometers, the
police of Paris having asked the opinion of the Institute
as to the safety of certain new kinds, lately introduced.
The subject excited great interest, and the debate was
quite animated. Thénard, Gay-Lussac, Girard, Laplace,
Cuvier, and others, engaged in the debate. Nearly all
expressed themselves with great ease and even volubility.
They were occasionally vehement, and when excited several
spoke at once, and the president was obliged often to
ring his bell to preserve order.</p>

<p>"It was strange and striking to see so many old men,
just on the borders of the grave, still retaining such ardor
for science as to appear at a club like this, and enter with
passion into all the questions that came up. Such a
spectacle is not to be seen elsewhere on the earth. The
charms of science generally fade to the eye of threescore
and ten: few passions except piety and avarice survive
threescore. It is evident, in studying this Association,
that the highest and most ardent exercises of the mind
are here stimulated by the desire of glory, which is the
reward of success. One thing struck me forcibly in this
assembly, and that was, the utter absence of all French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
foppery in dress among the members. Their attire was
plain black, and generally as simple as that of so many
New England clergymen.</p>

<p>"In the evening went to the Théâtre Français, to see
Talma in the celebrated tragedy of 'Sylla,' by Jouy. Do
not well understand the French, but could see that the
acting is very masterly. In the passionate parts there
was a display of vigor, but at other times the performance
was quiet and natural, without any of the stage exaggeration
I am accustomed to. Most of the scenes were such
as might actually take place under the circumstances indicated
in the play. Talma is said to resemble Napoleon
in person: he certainly looked very much like his portraits.
His hair was evidently arranged to favor the idea
of resemblance to the Emperor. He is a very handsome
man, and comes up to my idea of a great actor.</p>

<p>"February 20.&mdash;Went to see a new comedy by Casimir
Delavigne, 'L'Ecole des Vieillards.' Talma and
Mademoiselle Mars played the two principal parts. The
piece consisted of a succession of rather long dialogues,
without any change of scenery. Talma is inimitable in
the character of a refined but somewhat imbecile man,
who has passed the prime of life; and Mademoiselle
Mars is, beyond comparison, the most graceful and pleasing
of actresses. I am struck with the strict propriety,
the refinement even, of the manners of the audience.</p>

<p>"February 21st.&mdash;Went to the Hospital of La Charité.
Saw Laennec, with his pupils, visiting the patients. He
makes great use of the stethoscope, which is a wooden
tube applied to the body, and put to the ear; by the
sound, the state of the lungs and the vital organs is ascertained.
It is like a telescope, by which the interior of
the body is perceived, only that the ear is used instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the eye. It is deemed a great improvement. Laennec
is the inventor, and has high reputation in the treatment
of diseases of the chest. He has learned to ascertain the
condition of the lungs by thumping on the breast and
back of the patient, and putting the ear to the body at
the same time.</p>

<p>"The whole hospital was neat and clean; bedsteads of
iron. French medical practice very light; few medicines
given; nursing is a great part of the treatment.</p>

<p>"Same day, went to Hôtel Dieu, a medical and surgical
hospital. Saw Dupuytren and his pupils visiting the
patients. He holds the very first rank as a surgeon. His
operations are surprisingly bold and skilful. Edward
C&mdash;&mdash;, of Philadelphia, who is here studying medicine,
told me a good anecdote of him. He has a notion that
he can instantly detect hydrocephalus in a patient from
the manner in which he carries his head. One day,
while he was in the midst of his scholars at the hospital,
he saw a common sort of man standing at a distance,
among several persons who had come for medical advice.
Dupuytren's eye fell upon him, and he said to his pupils,&mdash;'Do
you see yonder that fellow that has his hand to his
face, and carries his head almost on his shoulder? Now,
take notice: that man has hydrocephalus. Come here,
my good fellow!'</p>

<p>"The man thus called came up. 'Well,' said Dupuytren,
'I know what ails you; but come, tell us about it
yourself. What is the matter with you?'</p>

<p>"'I've got the toothache!' was the reply.</p>

<p>"'Take that,' said Dupuytren, giving him a box on
the ear; 'and go to the proper department and have it
pulled out!'"</p>

<p>I was again in Paris in the summer of 1832. Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
changes had taken place since 1824. Louis XVIII. was
dead; Charles X. had succeeded; and, after a brief reign,
had been driven away by the revolution of the "Three Glorious
Days." Louis Philippe was now on the throne. On
the 29th of July, and the two following days, we saw the
celebration of the event which had thus changed the dynasty
of France. It consisted of a grand fête, in the
Champs Elysées, closed by a most imposing military spectacle,
in which eighty thousand troops, extending from
the Arc de Triomphe to the Place Vendôme, marched
before the admiring throng. Louis Philippe was himself
on horseback as commander-in-chief, and such was his
popularity among the masses, that, in many instances, I
saw men in blouses rush up and grasp his hand, and insist
upon shaking it. Sixteen years after I saw him
hustled into a cab, and flying from the mob for his life&mdash;his
family scattered, and he but too happy to get safe to
England in the disguise of a sailor!</p>

<p>As I have said, I established my family in Paris in
1846; that winter and the following I was also there. I
remember that on a certain Monday in February, 1848,
I went up to see our countrywoman, the Marchioness Lavalette,
to arrange with her about an introduction she had
promised me to Guizot. She was not at home, but as I
was coming down the hill from the Place St. George, I
met her in her carriage. She asked me to walk back to
her house, and I did so. I observed that she was much
agitated, and asked her the cause. "We are going to
have trouble!" said she. "I have just been to the
Chambers: the ministry have determined to stop the
meeting of the Liberals to-morrow; the proclamation is
already being printed."</p>

<p>"Well, and what then?" said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Another 'Three Glorious Days!'"</p>

<p>To this I replied that I conceived her fears groundless,
that Louis Philippe appeared to me strong in the confidence
of the people; that he was noted for his prudence
and sagacity; that Guizot, his prime minister, was a man
of great ability; that the whole cabinet, indeed, were
distinguished for their judgment and capacity. The lady
shook her head and rejoined,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know Paris better than you do. We are on the
eve of an earthquake!"</p>

<p>Soon after this I took my leave. What speedily ensued
may best be told in another chapter, by a few extracts
from a letter I addressed to a friend in Boston at
the time.</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, March 14th, 1848.<br />
</p>

<p>It may be well to state a few particulars as to the political
condition of France at the moment of the revolt.</p>

<p>Louis Philippe commenced his career under fair auspices,
and for a time everything promised a happy fulfilment
of what seemed his duty and his destiny. But by
degrees a great change came over the monarch; the
possession of power seduced his heart, and turned his
head; and forgetting his pledges, and blind to his true
interest, he set himself to building up a dynasty that
should hand down his name and fame to posterity.</p>

<p>It seemed, at a superficial glance, that he might realize
his dream. He had acquired the reputation of being the
most sagacious monarch of his time. He had improved
and embellished the capital; on all sides his "image and
superscription" were seen in connection with works of
beauty and utility. France was happier than the adjacent
countries. The famine and the pestilence, that had
recently desolated neighboring states, had trod more
lightly here. The king was blessed with a large family.
These had all reached maturity, and were allied to kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and queens, princes and princesses. The upholders of
the Crown in the parliament were men whose names
alone were a tower of strength. Peace reigned at home,
and the army abroad had just succeeded in achieving a
signal triumph over an enemy that had baffled them for
years.</p>

<p>Such was the outward seeming of affairs: but there
were threatening fires within which might at any moment
produce a conflagration. Many thinking people
were profoundly disgusted with the retrograde tendency
of the Government. Although the march of despotism
had been cautious and stealthy, the people generally
began to feel the tyranny to which they had become
subjected.</p>

<p>Among these grievances were the constant increase of
the national debt, and consequent increase of taxation,
with the restraints put upon the liberty of the press and
of speech. By a law of some years' standing the people
were prohibited from holding stated meetings of more
than twenty persons without license; and <i>reform banquets</i>,
or meetings for the discussion of public affairs&mdash;of
which about seventy had been held in different parts
of the kingdom within the last year&mdash;were now pronounced
illegal by the ministry. Finally, a determination
to suppress one of them, about to be held in the twelfth
ward of Paris, was solemnly announced by the Ministry
in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

<p>It is material to bear in mind, that there are always in
this metropolis at least one hundred thousand workmen
who live from day to day upon their labor, and who,
upon the slightest check to trade, are plunged into poverty,
if not starvation. At the moment of which we are
speaking, this immense body of men, with their families,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
were suffering sorely from the stagnation of business in
the capital. There were not less than two hundred
thousand persons who, for the space of three months, had
hardly been able to obtain sufficient food to appease the
cravings of hunger. How easy to stir up these people to
rebellion!&mdash;how natural for them to turn their indignation
against the king and his government! The "Opposition"
members seized the occasion now afforded them
to excite these discontented masses against the ministry;
and the latter, by their rashness, did more than their
enemies to prepare the mind and set the match to the
train.</p>

<p>The crisis was now at hand. The "Opposition" deputies
declared their intention to attend the proposed meeting;
and in spite of the threats of the ministry, the
preparations for the banquet went vigorously on. A
place was selected in the Champs Elysées, and a building
was in progress of erection for the celebration. The
programme of the same was announced; the toast for
the occasion was published; the orator, O. Barrot, selected.
The day was fixed: an ominous day for tyranny, an
auspicious one for human freedom. It was the 22d of
February, the birthday of Washington! Whether it
has received a new title to its place in the calendar of
liberty, must be left for the decision of time.</p>

<p>The evening of the 21st came, and then proclamations
were issued, by the co-operation of the ministry and the
police prohibiting the banquet. This act, though it had
been threatened, still fell like a thunderbolt upon the
people. It was known that an immense military force
had been quietly assembled in Paris and the vicinity&mdash;eighty
thousand troops, with artillery and ample munitions&mdash;and
that the garrisons around the Tuileries had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
been victualled as if for a siege. But it had not been
believed that an attempt to stifle the voice of the people,
so bold as this, would really be made. Yet such was the
fact. The leaders of the "Opposition" receded from
their ground; and it was announced, in the papers of
the 22d, that the banquet, being forbidden by the Government,
would not take place.</p>

<p>The morning of this day was dark and drizzly. I
had anticipated some manifestation of uneasiness, and at
half-past nine o'clock went forth. Groups of people were
reading the proclamations posted up at the corners of the
streets, but all was tranquil. I walked along the Boulevards
for a mile yet saw no symptoms of the coming
storm.</p>

<p>The designated place of meeting for the banquet was
the square of the Madeleine. This is at the western
extremity of the Boulevards, and near the great central
square called the Place de la Concorde, a point communicating
directly with the Chamber of Deputies, the
Champs Elysées, the gardens of the Tuileries, &amp;c. At
eleven o'clock, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, a dark mass was seen moving along the
Boulevards towards the proposed place of meeting. This
consisted of thousands of workmen from the faubourgs.
In a few moments the entire square of the Madeleine
was filled with these persons, dressed almost exclusively
in their characteristic costume, which consists of a blue
tunic, called <i>blouse</i>&mdash;a garment which is made very much
in the fashion of our farmers' frocks.</p>

<p>The opening scene of the drama had now begun. The
mass rushed and eddied around the Madeleine, which, by
the way, is the finest church and the finest edifice in
Paris. Such was the threatening aspect of the scene,
that the shops were all suddenly shut, and the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
around began to supply themselves, with bread and other
food, for "three days." In a few moments the avalanche
took its course down the Rue Royale, swept across the
Place de la Concorde, traversed the bridge over the
Seine, and collected, in swelling and heaving masses, in
the place, or square, before the Chamber of Deputies.
This building is defended in front by a high iron railing.
The gate of this was soon forced, and some hundreds of
the people rushed up the long flight of steps, and, pausing
beneath the portico, struck up the song of the "Marseillaise"&mdash;a
song, by the way, interdicted by law on account
of its exciting character. The crowd here rapidly
increased: shouts, songs, cries filled the air. East and
west, along the quays, and through the streets behind
the Chamber, came long lines of students from the various
schools. Standing upon one of the pillars of the bridge,
I commanded a view of the whole scene. It was one to
fill the heart with the liveliest emotions. A hundred
thousand people were now collected, seeming like an
agitated sea, and sending forth a murmur resembling the
voice of many waters. From the southern gate of the
Tuileries now issued two bodies of troops&mdash;one, on horseback,
coming along the northern quay. These were the
Municipal Guard, a magnificent corps, richly caparisoned,
and nobly mounted. Being picked men, and well paid,
they were the chief reliance of the Government, and for
that very reason were hated by the people. The other
body of troops were infantry of the line, and, crossing the
Pont Royal, came along the southern bank of the river.
Both detachments approached the multitude, and crowding
upon them with a slow advance, succeeded at last in
clearing the space before the Chamber.</p>

<p>The greater part of the throng recrossed the bridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and spread themselves over the Place de la Concorde.
This square, perhaps the most beautiful in the world, is
about five acres in extent. This vast area was now
crowded with an excited populace, mainly of the working
classes. Their number constantly augmented, and bodies
of troops, foot and horse, arrived from various quarters,
till the square was literally covered. The number of persons
here collected in one mass was over one hundred
thousand.</p>

<p>At the commencement, the mob amused themselves
with songs and shouts; but in clearing the space before
the Chamber, and driving the people across the bridge,
the guards had displayed great rudeness. They pressed
upon the masses, and one woman was crushed to death
beneath the hoofs of the horses. Pebbles now began to
be hurled at the troops from the square. Dashing in
among the people, sword in hand, the cavalry drove them
away; but as they cleared one spot, another was immediately
filled. The effect of this was to chafe and
irritate the mob, who now began to seize sticks and
stones, and hurl them in good earnest at their assailants.</p>

<p>While this petty war was going on, some thousands of
the rioters dispersed themselves through the Champs
Elysées, and began to build barricades across the main
avenue. The chairs, amounting to many hundreds, were
immediately disposed in three lines across the street.
Benches, trellises, boxes, fences&mdash;every movable thing
within reach&mdash;were soon added to the barricades. An
omnibus passing by was captured, detached from the
horses, and tumbled into one of the lines. The flag was
taken from the Panorama near by, and a vast procession
paraded through the grounds, singing the "Marseillaise,"
the "Parisienne," and other patriotic airs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, a small detachment of foot guards advanced
to the scene of action; but they were pelted with
stones, and took shelter in their guard-house. This was
assailed with a shower of missiles, which rattled like hail
upon its roof. The windows were dashed in, and a heap
of brush near by was laid to the wall, and set on fire. A
body of horse guards soon arrived, and dispersed the
rioters; but the latter crossed to the northern side of the
Champs Elysées, attacked another guard-house, and set
it on fire. A company of the line came to the spot, but
the mob cheered them, and they remained inactive. The
revel proceeded, and, in the face of the soldiers, the people
fed the fire with fuel from the surrounding trees and
fences, sang their songs, cracked their jokes, and cried
"Down with Guizot!" "Vive la Réforme!" &amp;c. In these
scenes the boys took the lead, performing the most
desperate feats, and inspiring the rest by their intrepidity.
A remarkable air of fun and frolic characterized the mob&mdash;jokes
flew as freely on all sides as stones and sticks.</p>

<p>Such was the course of events the first day, so far as
they fell under my own observation. It appears from the
papers that similar proceedings, though in some cases of
a more serious character, took place elsewhere. Great
masses of people gathered at various points. They made
hostile demonstrations before the Office of Foreign
Affairs, crying out, "Down with Guizot!" Some person
called for the minister. "He is not here," said one; "he
is with the Countess Lieven,"&mdash;a remark which the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</i> of Paris will understand as conveying a keen
satire. At other points a spirit of insubordination was
manifested. Bakers' shops were broken open, armories
forced, and barricades begun. Everywhere the hymn of
the "Marseillaise" and "Mourir pour la Patrie" were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
sung&mdash;often by hundreds of voices, and with thrilling
effect. The rappel for calling out the National Guard
was beaten in several quarters. As night closed in,
heavy masses of soldiery, horse and foot, with trains of
artillery, were seen at various points. The Place du
Carrousel was full of troops, and at evening they were
reviewed by the King and the Dukes of Nemours and
Montpensier. Six thousand soldiers were disposed along
the boulevards from the Madeleine to the Porte St.
Martin. Patrols were seen in different quarters during
the whole night. About twelve tranquillity reigned over
the city, disturbed only in a few remote and obscure
places by the building of barricades, the arrest of rioters,
and one or two combats, in which several persons were
killed. Such was the first day's work&mdash;the prelude to
the drama about to follow.</p>

<p>Wednesday, the 23d, was fair, with dashes of rain at
intervals, as in our April. I was early abroad, and soon
noticed that companies of National Guards were on duty.
Only regular troops had been called out the day before&mdash;a
fact which showed the distrust of the National Guards
entertained by the king. This was remarked by the latter,
and was doubtless one of the causes which hastened
the destruction of the Government.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock I passed up the Boulevards. Most of the
shops were shut, and an air of uneasiness prevailed among
the people. At the Porte St. Denis there was a great
throng, and a considerable mass of troops. Barricades
were soon after erected in the streets of St. Denis, Cléry,
St. Eustache, Cadran, &amp;c. Several fusilades took place
between the people at these points and the soldiers, and
a number of persons were killed.</p>

<p>Some contests occurred in other quarters during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
morning. At two o'clock the Boulevards, the Rues St.
Denis, St. Martin, Montmartre, St. Honoré&mdash;in short, all
the great thoroughfares&mdash;were literally crammed with
people. Bodies of horse and foot, either stationary or
patrolling, were everywhere to be seen. It was about
this time that some officers of the National Guard ordered
their men to fire, but they refused. In one instance four
hundred National Guards were seen marching, in uniform,
but without arms. It became evident that the soldiers
generally were taking part with the people. This news
was carried to the palace, and Count Molé was called in
to form a new ministry. He undertook the task, and
orders were immediately given to spread the intelligence
of this through the city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the riot and revel went on in various quarters.
The police were active, and hundreds of persons
were arrested and lodged in prison. Skirmishes took
place, here and there, between the soldiers and the
people; long processions were seen, attended by persons
who sang choruses, and shouted "Down with Guizot!"
"Vive la Réforme!"</p>

<p>About four o'clock the news of the downfall of the
Guizot ministry was spread along the Boulevards. The
joyful intelligence ran over the city with the speed of
light. It was everywhere received with acclamations.
The people and the troops, a short time before looking at
each other in deadly hostility, were seen shaking hands,
and expressing congratulations. An immense population&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;poured into the Boulevards,
to share in the jubilation. Large parties of the
National Guard paraded the streets, the officers and men
shouting "Vive la Réforme!" and the crowd cheering
loudly. Bands of five hundred to fifteen hundred men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
and boys went about making noisy demonstrations of joy.
On being met by the troops, they divided to let them
pass, and immediately resumed their cries and their songs.</p>

<p>Toward half-past six o'clock in the evening an illumination
was spoken of, and many persons lighted up spontaneously.
The illumination soon became more general,
and the populace, in large numbers, went through the
streets, calling, "Light up!" Numerous bands, alone or
following detachments of the National Guards, went
about, shouting "Vive le Roi!" "Vive la Réforme!" and
singing the "Marseillaise." At many points, where barricades
had been erected, and the people were resisting
the troops, they ceased when they heard the news of the
resignations, and the troops retired. "It is all over!"
was the general cry; and a feeling of relief seemed to
pervade every bosom.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that, but for a fatal occurrence
which soon after took place, the further progress of the
revolt might have been stayed. Many wise people now
say, indeed, that the revolution was all planned beforehand;
they had foreseen and predicted it: and from the
beginning of the outbreak everything tended to this
point. The fact is unquestionably otherwise. The "Opposition,"
with their various clubs and societies distributed
through all classes in Paris, and holding constant communication
with the workmen or blousemen, no doubt
stood ready to take advantage of any violence on the part
of the Government which might justify resistance; but
they had not anticipated such a contingency on the
present occasion. It is not probable that the Molé ministry,
had it been consummated, would have satisfied the
people; but the king had yielded; Guizot, the special
object of hatred, had fallen, and it was supposed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
further concessions would be made, as concession had begun.
But accident, which often rules the fate of empires
and dynasties, now stepped in to govern the course
of events, and give them a character which should astonish
the world.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening a large mass of people
had collected on the Boulevard, in the region of Guizot's
office&mdash;the Hôtel des Affaires Etrangères. The troops
here had unfortunately threatened the people, by rushing
at them with fixed bayonets, after the announcement of
the resignation of the ministry, and when a good feeling
prevailed among all classes. This irritated the mob, and
was partly, no doubt, the occasion of the large gathering
in this quarter. For some reason, not well explained, a
great many troops had also assembled here and in the
vicinity. At ten o'clock, the street from the Madeleine
to the Rue de la Paix was thronged with soldiers and
people. There was, however, no riot and no symptom
of disorder.</p>

<p>At this moment a collection of persons, mostly young
men, about sixty in number, came along the Boulevard,
on the side opposite to the soldiers and the Foreign
Office. It is said that the colonel anticipated some
attack, though nothing of the kind was threatened. It
appears that the soldiers stood ready to fire, when one of
their muskets went off, and wounded the commander's
horse in the leg. He mistook this for a shot from the
crowd, and gave instant orders to fire. A fusilade immediately
followed. Twenty persons fell dead, and forty
were wounded. The scene which ensued baffles description.
The immense masses dispersed in terror, and carried
panic in all directions. The groans of the dying
and the screams of the wounded filled the air. Shops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
and houses around were turned into hospitals. "We are
betrayed! we are betrayed!"&mdash;"Revenge! revenge!"
was the cry of the masses.</p>

<p>From this moment the doom of the monarchy was
sealed. The leaders of the clubs, no doubt, took their
measures for revolution. An immense waggon was soon
brought to the scene of the massacre; the dead bodies
were laid on it, and flaring torches were lighted over it.
The ghastly spectacle was paraded through the streets,
and the mute lips of the corpses doubtless spoke more
effectively than those of the living. Large masses of
people, pale with excitement and uttering execrations
upon the murderers, followed in the train of the waggon,
as it passed through the more populous streets of the
city, and especially in those quarters inhabited by the
lower classes. The effect was such as might have been
anticipated. At midnight the barricades were begun,
and at sunrise the streets of Paris displayed a network
of fortifications from the Place St. George to the church
of Notre Dame, which set the troops at defiance. More
than a thousand barricades, some of them ten feet in
height, were thrown up during that memorable night;
yet such were the suddenness and silence of the operations,
that most of the inhabitants of the city slept in
security, fondly dreaming that the tempest had passed,
and that the morning would greet them in peace.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the decisive day, the weather was still
mild and without rain, though the sky was dimmed with
clouds. At eleven in the morning I sallied forth. I
cannot express my astonishment at the scene. The
whole Boulevard was a spectacle of desolation. From
the Rue de la Paix to the Rue Montmartre&mdash;the finest
part of Paris, the glory of the city&mdash;every tree was cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
down, all the public monuments reduced to heaps of
ruins, the pavements torn up, and the entire wreck
tumbled into a succession of barricades. Every street
leading into this portion of the Boulevard was strongly
barricaded. Such giant operations seemed like the work
of enchantment.</p>

<p>But my wonder had only begun. At the point where
the Rue Montmartre crosses the Boulevard, the entire
pavement was torn up, and something like a square
breastwork was formed, in which a cannon was planted.
The whole space around was crowded with the populace.
As I stood for a moment surveying the scene, a young
man, about twenty, passed through the crowd, and stepping
upon the carriage of the cannon, cried out, "Down
with Louis Philippe!" The energy with which this was
spoken sent a thrill through every bosom; and the remarkable
appearance of the youth gave additional effect
to his words. He was short, broad-shouldered, and full-chested.
His face was pale, his cheek spotted with
blood, and his head, without hat or cap, was bound with
a handkerchief. His features were keen, and his deep-set
eye was lit with a spark that seemed borrowed from
a tiger. As he left the throng he came near me, and I
said, inquiringly, "Down with Louis Philippe?" "Yes!"
was his reply. "And what then?" said I. "A republic!"
was his answer; and he passed on, giving the
watchword of "Down with Louis Philippe!" to the
masses he encountered. This was the first instance in
which I heard the overthrow of the king and the adoption
of a republic proposed.</p>

<p>In pursuing my walk, I noticed that the population
were now abundantly supplied with weapons. On the
two first days they were unarmed; but after the slaughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
at the Foreign Office they went to all the houses and demanded
weapons. These were given, for refusal would
have been vain. An evidence of the consideration of the
populace, even in their hour of wrath, is furnished by the
fact, that in all cases where the arms had been surrendered,
they wrote on the doors in chalk, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Armes données</i>"&mdash;Arms
given up; so as to prevent the annoyance
of a second call.</p>

<p>It might seem a fearful thing to behold a mob, such as
that of Paris, brandishing guns, fowling-pieces, swords,
cutlasses, hatchets, and axes; but I must say that I felt
not the slightest fear in passing among their thickest
masses. Some of them, who had doubtless never handled
arms before, seemed a little jaunty and jubilant.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamins</i>&mdash;the leaders in riots, rows, and rebellions&mdash;were
swarming on all sides, and seemed to feel a head
taller in the possession of their weapons. I saw several
of these unwashed imps strutting about with red sashes
around the waist, supporting pistols, dirks, cutlasses, &amp;c.;
yet I must state that over the whole scene there was an
air of good-breeding, which seemed a guarantee against
insult or violence. I may also remark here, that during
the whole three days I did not observe a scuffle or
wrangle among the people; I did not hear an insulting
word, nor did I see a menace offered, save in conflicts
between the soldiers and the populace. I can add, that
I did not see a drunken person during the whole period,
with the single exception which I shall hereafter mention.</p>

<p>I took a wide circuit in the region of the Rue Montmartre,
the Bourse, the Rue Vivienne, St. Honoré, and
the Palais Royal. Everywhere there were enormous
barricades and crowds of armed people. Soon after&mdash;that
is, about twelve o'clock&mdash;I passed the southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
quadrangle of the Palais Royal, which, lately the residence
of the brother of the King of Naples, was now
attacked and taken by the populace. The beautiful suite
of rooms was richly furnished, and decorated with costly
pictures, statues, bronzes, and other specimens of art.
These were unsparingly tumbled into the square and the
street, and consigned to the flames. At the distance of
one hundred and fifty feet from the front of the Palais
Royal was the Château d'Eau, a massive stone building
occupied as a barrack, and at this moment garrisoned by
one hundred and eighty municipal guards. In most parts
of the city, seeing that the troops fraternized with the
people, the Government had given them orders not to
fire. These guards, however, attacked the insurgents in
and about the Palais Royal. Their fire was returned,
and a desperate conflict ensued. The battle lasted for
more than an hour, the people rushing in the very face
of the muskets, of the guard, as they blazed from the
grated windows. At last the barrack was set on fire,
and the guard yielded, though not till many of their
number had fallen, and the rest were nearly dead with
suffocation. The Château d'Eau is now a mere ruin, its
mottled walls giving evidence of the shower of bullets
that had been poured upon it.</p>

<p>No sooner had the Château d'Eau surrendered, than
the flushed victors took their course towards the Tuileries,
which was near at hand; shouting, singing, roaring, they
came like a surge, bearing all before them. The Place
du Carrousel was filled with troops; but not a sword was
unsheathed&mdash;not a bayonet pointed&mdash;not a musket or a
cannon fired. There stood, idle and motionless, the
mighty armament which the king had appointed for his
defence. How vain had his calculations proved! for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
alas! they were founded in a radical error. The soldiers
would not massacre their brethren, to sustain a throne
which they now despised.</p>

<p>But we must now enter the Tuileries. For several days
previous to the events we have described, some anxiety
had been entertained by persons in and about the palace.
The king, however, had no fears. He appeared in unusual
spirits; and, if any intimation of danger was given,
he turned it aside with a sneer or a joke. Even so late
as Wednesday, after he had called upon Count Molé to
form a new ministry, he remarked that he was so "firmly
seated in the saddle, that nothing could throw him off."</p>

<p>Molé soon found it impossible, with the materials at
hand, to construct a ministry. Thiers was then called
in; and, after a long course of higgling and chaffering
on the part of the king, it was agreed that he and Barrot
should undertake to carry on the Government. This
was announced by them in person, as they rode through
the streets on Thursday morning. These concessions,
however, came too late. The cry for a republic was
bursting from the lips of the million. The abdication of
the king was decreed, and a raging multitude were demanding
this at the very gates of the palace. Overborne
by the crisis, the king agreed to abdicate in favor of the
Duke de Nemours. Some better tidings were brought
him, and he retracted what he had just done. A moment
after it became certain that the insurgents would shortly
burst into the palace. In great trepidation, the king
agreed to resign the crown in favor of his grandson, the
young Count de Paris; yet, still clinging to the hope, he
shuffled and hesitated before he would put his name to
the act of abdication. This, however, was at last done,
and the king and queen, dressed in black, and accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
by a few individuals who remained faithful in this
trying moment, passed from the Tuileries to the Place de
la Concorde, through the subterranean passage constructed
many years previously for the walks of the infant
King of Rome. They here entered a small, one-horse
vehicle, and, after a rapid and successful flight, landed
safely at Dover, in England.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the mob had seized the royal carriages,
fourteen in number, and made a bonfire of them, near
the celebrated arch in the Place du Carrousel. Soon
after, they forced the railing at several points, and came
rushing across the square toward the palace. Scarcely had
the various members of the royal family time to escape
on one side of the building, when the mob broke in at
the other.</p>

<p>I have not time to follow the adventures of these several
individuals. We cannot but sympathize with them
in their misfortunes; but we may remark, that the fall
of the Orleans dynasty was not broken by a single act of
courage or dignity on the part of any one of the family.
Their flight seemed a vulgar scramble for mere life.
Even the king was reduced to the most common place
disguises&mdash;the shaving of his whiskers, the change of his
dress, the adopting an "alias!" I may add here, that
they have all escaped; and while everybody seems glad of
this, there is no one behind who mourns their loss. None
are more loud in denouncing the besotted confidence of
the king than his two hundred and twenty-five purchased
deputies, who were so loyal in the days of prosperity.</p>

<p>A short time after the king and queen had passed the
Place de la Concorde I chanced to be there. In a few
moments Odillon Barrot appeared from the gate of the
Tuileries, and, followed by a long train of persons, proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to the Chamber of Deputies. It was now understood
that the king had abdicated, and that Thiers and
Barrot were to propose the Count de Paris as king, under
the regency of his mother, the Duchess of Orleans. The
most profound emotion seemed to occupy the immense
multitude. All were hushed into silence by the rapid
succession of astonishing events. After a short space the
Duchess of Orleans, with her two sons, the Count de
Paris and the Duke de Chartres, were seen on foot coming
toward the Chamber, encircled by a strong escort.
She was dressed in deep mourning, her face bent to the
ground. She moved across the bridge, and passing to
the rear of the building, entered it through the gardens.
Shortly after this the Duke de Nemours, attended by
several gentlemen on horseback, rode up, and also entered
the building.</p>

<p>The scene that ensued within is said to have presented
an extraordinary mixture of the solemn and the ludicrous.
The duchess being present, Barrot proceeded to
state the abdication of the king, and to propose the
regency. It was then that Lamartine seemed to shake
off the poet and philosopher, and suddenly to become a
man of action. Seizing the critical moment, he declared
his conviction that the days of monarchy were numbered;
that the proposed regency was not suited to the crisis;
and that a republic alone would meet the emergency and
the wishes of France. These opinions, happily expressed
and strenuously enforced, became decisive in their effect.</p>

<p>Several other speeches were made, and a scene of great
confusion followed. A considerable number of the mob
had broken into the room, and occupied the galleries and
the floor. One of them brought his firelock to his
shoulder, and took aim at M. Sauzet, the president.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Entirely losing his self-possession, he abdicated with great
speed, and disappeared. In the midst of the hubbub a
Provisional Government was announced, and the leading
members were named. Some of the more obnoxious
deputies were aimed at by the muskets of the mob, and
skulking behind benches and pillars, they oozed out at
back-doors and windows. A blouseman came up to the
Duke de Nemours, who drew his sword. The man took
it from him, broke it over his knee, and counselled his
highness to depart. This he did forthwith, having borrowed
a coat and hat for the purpose of disguise. A
call was made for the members of the Provisional Government
to proceed to the Hôtel de Ville. The assembly
broke up, and the curtain fell upon the last sitting
of the Chamber of Deputies&mdash;the closing scene of
Louis Philippe's government.</p>

<p>It was about three o'clock in the afternoon that I
retraced my steps toward the Tuileries. The Place de
la Concorde was crowded with soldiers, and fifty cannon
were ranged in front of the gardens. Yet this mighty
force seemed struck with paralysis. Long lines of
infantry stood mute and motionless, and heavy masses of
cavalry seemed converted into so many statues. Immediately
before the eyes of those soldiers was the palace
of the Tuileries in full possession of the mob, but not a
muscle moved for their expulsion!</p>

<p>Passing into the gardens, I noticed that thousands of
persons were spread over their surface, and a rattling
discharge of fire-arms was heard on all sides. Looking
about for the cause of this, I perceived that hundreds of
men and boys were amusing themselves with shooting
sparrows and pigeons, which had hitherto found a secure
resting-place in this favorite resort of leisure and luxury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Others were discharging their muskets for the mere fun
of making a noise. Proceeding through the gardens, I
came at last to the palace. It had now been, for more
than an hour, in full possession of the insurgents. All
description fails to depict a scene like this. The whole
front of the Tuileries, one-eighth of a mile in length,
seemed gushing at doors, windows, balconies, and galleries,
with living multitudes&mdash;a mighty beehive of men,
in the very act of swarming. A confused hubbub filled
the air, and bewildered the senses with its chaotic
sounds.</p>

<p>At the moment I arrived the throne of the king was
borne away by a jubilant band of revellers; and, after
being paraded through the streets, was burned at the
Place de la Bastille.</p>

<p>I entered the palace, and passed through the long
suites of apartments devoted to occasions of ceremony.
A year before I had seen these gorgeous halls filled with
the flush and the fair&mdash;kings, princes, and nobles&mdash;gathered
to this focal point of luxury, refinement, and
taste from every quarter of the world. How little did
Louis Philippe, at that moment, dream of "coming
events!" How little did the stately queen&mdash;a proud
obelisk of silk, and lace, and diamonds&mdash;foresee the
change that was at hand! I recollected well the effect
of this scene upon my own mind, and felt the full force
of the contrast which the present moment offered. In
the very room where I had seen the pensive and pensile
Princess de Joinville and the Duchess de Montpensier&mdash;the
latter then fresh from the hymeneal altar, her raven
hair studded with diamonds like evening stars&mdash;whirling
in the mazy dance, I now beheld a band of creatures like
Calibans, gambolling to the song of the "Marseillaise!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>On every side my eye fell upon scenes of destruction.
Passing to the other end of the palace, I beheld a mob in
the chambers of the princesses. Some rolled themselves
in the downy beds, others anointed their shaggy heads
with choice pomatum, exclaiming, "Dieu! how sweet it
smells!" One of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamins</i>, grimed with gunpowder,
blood, and dirt, seized a tooth-brush, and placing himself
before a mirror, seemed delighted at the manifest improvement
which he produced upon his ivory.</p>

<p>On leaving the palace, I saw numbers of the men
drinking wine from bottles taken from the well-stocked
cellars. None of them were positively drunk. To use
the words of "Tam O'Shanter," "They were na fou, but
just had plenty"&mdash;perhaps a little more. They flourished
their guns and pistols, brandished their swords, and
performed various antics, but they offered no insult to
any one. They seemed in excellent humor, and made
more than an ordinary display of French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">politesse</i>. They
complimented the women, of whom there was no lack;
and one of them, resembling a figure of Pan, seized a
maiden by the waist, and both rigadooned merrily over
the floor.</p>

<p>Leaving this scene of wreck, confusion, and uproar, I
proceeded toward the gate of the gardens leading into
the Rue de Rivoli. I was surprised to find here a couple
of ruthless-looking blousemen, armed with pistols, keeping
guard. On inquiry, I found that the mob themselves
had instituted a sort of government. One fellow, in the
midst of the devastation in the palace, seeing a man put
something into his pocket, wrote on the wall, "Death to
thieves!" The Draconian code was immediately adopted
by the people, and became the law of Paris. Five persons,
taken in acts of robbery, were shot down by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
people, and their bodies exposed in the streets, with the
label of "Thief" on their breast. Thus order and law
seemed to spring up from the instincts of society, in the
midst of uproar and confusion, as crystals are seen shooting
from the chaos of the elements.</p>

<p>Three days had now passed, and the revolution was
accomplished. The people soon returned to their wonted
habits; the Provisional Government proceeded in its
duties; the barricades disappeared; and in a single week
the more obtrusive traces of the storm that had passed
had vanished from the streets and squares of Paris.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">AFTER THE REVOLUTION&mdash;"FUNERAL OF THE VICTIMS"&mdash;THE CONSTITUENT
ASSEMBLY&mdash;PARIS IN A STATE OF SIEGE&mdash;CAVAIGNAC&mdash;LOUIS NAPOLEON
CHOSEN PRESIDENT.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is not my design to enter into the history of the
revolution in detail, but I may sketch a few of the prominent
events which followed. For this purpose, I make
an extract from an account I have elsewhere given:&mdash;</p>

<p>For several weeks and months Paris was a scene of
extraordinary excitement. The Provisional Government
had announced that they would provide the people with
labor. Consequently, deputations of tailors, hatters, engravers,
musicians, paviors, cabinet-makers, seamstresses,
and a multitude of other trades and vocations, flocked in
long lines to the Hôtel de Ville to solicit the favor of the
Government. Vast crowds of people perpetually haunted
this place, and, in one instance, a raging multitude came
thundering at the doors, demanding that the blood-red
flag of the former revolution should be the banner of the
new republic! It was on this occasion that Lamartine
addressed the people, and with such eloquence as to
allay the storm which threatened again to deluge France
in blood. The members of the Government were so besieged
and pressed by business, that for several weeks
they slept in the Hôtel de Ville. They proceeded with
a bold hand to announce and establish the republic. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
order to make a favorable impression upon the people,
they decreed a gorgeous ceremony at the foot of the
column of July, on Sunday, February 27th, by which
they solemnly inaugurated the new republic. All the
members of the Provisional Government were present on
horseback; there were sixty thousand troops and two
hundred thousand people to witness the spectacle.</p>

<p>Another still more imposing celebration took place on
the 4th of March. This was called the "Funeral of the
Victims." After religious ceremonies at the Madeleine,
the members of the Government, with a long train of
public officers and an immense <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortège</i> of military, proceeded
to the July column, conducting a superb funeral-car,
drawn by eight cream-colored horses. This contained
most of the bodies of those slain in the revolution&mdash;about
two hundred and fifty. These were deposited
in the vault of the column, with the victims of the revolution
of 1830.</p>

<p>Nothing can adequately portray this spectacle. A tri-colored
flag was stretched on each side of the Boulevards,
from the Madeleine to the July column&mdash;a distance
of three miles. As this consisted of three strips of cloth,
the length of the whole was eighteen miles! The solemn
movement of the funeral procession, the dirge-like music,
the march of nearly a hundred thousand soldiers, and
the sympathizing presence of three hundred thousand
souls, rendered it a scene never surpassed and rarely
equalled, either by the magnificence of the panorama or
the solemn and touching sentiments excited.</p>

<p>Still other spectacles succeeded; and in the summer
four hundred thousand people assembled in the Champs
Elysées to witness the Presentation of Flags to the assembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
National Guards, eighty thousand being present.
Such scenes can only be witnessed in Paris.</p>

<p>Events proceeded with strange rapidity. A Constituent
Assembly was called by the Provisional Government
to form a constitution. The members were elected by
ballot, the suffrage being universal&mdash;that is, open to all
Frenchmen over twenty-one. The election took place in
April, and on the 4th of May the first session was held,
being officially announced to the assembled people from
the steps of the Chamber of Deputies. On the 15th of
May a conspiracy was disclosed, the leaders of which
were Raspail, Barbès, Sobrier, Caussidière, Blanqui,
Flotte, Albert, and Louis Blanc&mdash;the two last having
been members of the Provisional Government. Caussidière
was prefect of police.</p>

<p>The Assembly proceeded in the work of framing a
constitution, administering the government in the mean
time. On the 24th of June a terrific insurrection broke
out, promoted by the leaders of various factions, all desiring
the overthrow of the republic which had been inaugurated.
Cavaignac, who was minister of war, was
appointed dictator, and Paris was declared in a state of
siege. The insurgents confined their operations chiefly
to the faubourgs of St. Jacques and St. Antoine. They
got possession of these, and formed skilful and able plans
of operation, which had for their ultimate object the surrounding
of the city and getting possession of certain important
points, including the Chamber&mdash;thus securing the
government in their own hands.</p>

<p>Cavaignac proceeded to attack the barricades, thus
clearing the streets one by one. The fighting was terrible.
For four days the battle continued, the sound of
cannon frequently filling the ears of the people all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the city. Night and day the inhabitants were shut up in
their houses, ignorant of all, save that the conflict was
raging. The women found employment in scraping lint
for the wounded. All Paris was a camp. The windows
were closed; the soldiers and sentinels passed their
watchwords; litters, carrying the dead and wounded,
were borne along the streets; the tramp of marching
columns and the thunder of rushing cavalry broke upon
the ear!</p>

<p>At last the conflict was over; the insurgents were
beaten&mdash;Cavaignac triumphed. But the victory was
dearly purchased. Between two and three thousand
persons were killed, and among them no less than seven
general officers had fallen. The insurgents fought like
tigers. Many women were in the ranks, using the musket,
carrying the banners, rearing barricades, and cheering
the fight. Boys and girls mingled in the conflict.
The National Guards who combated them had equal
courage and superior discipline. One of the Garde Mobile&mdash;Hyacinthe
Martin, a youth of fourteen&mdash;took four
standards from the tops of the barricades. His gallantry
excited great interest, and Cavaignac decorated him with
the cross of the Legion of Honor. He became a hero
of the day; but&mdash;sad to relate!&mdash;being invited to fêtes,
banquets, and repasts, his head was turned, and he was
soon a ruined profligate.</p>

<p>The leaders in this terrific insurrection were never detected.
It is certain that the movement was headed by
able men, and directed by skilful engineers. The masses
who fought were roused to fury by poverty and distress&mdash;by
disappointment at finding the national workshops
discontinued, and by stimulating excitements furnished by
Socialist clubs and newspapers. It is computed that forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
thousand insurgents were in arms, and eighty thousand
government soldiers were brought against them. It may
be considered that this struggle was the remote but inevitable
result of the course of the Provisional Government
in adopting the doctrine of obligation, on the part
of the State, to supply work and wages to the people, and
in establishing national workshops in pursuance of this
idea. Still, it may be said, on the other hand, that nothing
but such a step could have enabled the Provisional
Government to maintain itself during three months, and
give being to an organized Assembly from which a legitimate
government could proceed.</p>

<p>The Constitution was finished in the autumn, and promulgated
on the 19th of November, 1848. On the 10th
of December following, the election of President took
place, and it appeared that Louis Napoleon Bonaparte
had five million out of seven million votes. He was
duly inaugurated about a week after the election, and
entered upon the high duties which thus devolved upon
him.</p>

<p>I now come to the period of 1851, when I entered
upon the consulate. Of the space during which I was
permitted to hold this office I have no very remarkable
personal incidents to relate. The certifying of invoices,
and the legalizing of deeds and powers of attorney,
are the chief technical duties of the American Consul at
Paris. If he desires to enlarge the circle of his operations,
however, he can find various ways of doing it. As,
for instance, in supplying the wants of distressed Poles,
Hungarians, Italians, and others, who are martyrs to
liberty, and suppose the American heart and purse always
open to those who are thus afflicted; in answering
questions from notaries, merchants, lawyers, as to the
laws of the different American States upon marriage,
inheritance, and the like; in advising emigrants whether
to settle in Iowa, or Illinois, or Missouri, or Texas; in
listening to inquiries made by deserted wives as to where
their errant husbands may be found, who left France ten,
or twenty, or thirty years ago, and went to America, by
which is generally understood St. Domingo or Martinique.
A considerable business may be done in lending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
money to foreigners, who pretend to have been naturalized
in the United States, and are, therefore, entitled to consideration
and sympathy: it being, of course, well understood
that money lent to such persons will never be
repaid. Some time and cash may also be invested in
listening to the stories and contributing to the wants of
promising young American artists, who are striving to
get to Italy to pursue their studies&mdash;such persons usually
being graduates of the London school of artful dodgers.
Some waste leisure and a good deal of postage may be
disposed of in correspondence with ingenious Americans,
inventors and discoverers: as, for instance, with a man in
Arkansas or Minnesota, who informs you that he has
contrived a new and infallible method of heating and
ventilating European cities, and wishes it brought to the
notice of the authorities there, it being deemed the duty
of the American Consul to give attention to such matters.
These monotonies are occasionally diversified by a
letter from some unfortunate fellow-countryman who is
detained at Mazas or Clichy, and begs to be extricated;
or some couple who wish to be put under the bonds of
wedlock; or some enterprising wife, all the way from
Tennessee, in chase of a runaway husband; or some
inexperienced but indignant youth who has been fleeced
by his landlord.</p>

<p>Such are the duties which devolve upon the American
Consul at Paris, the incidents alluded to having come
under my notice while I was there in that capacity. I
must now speak of certain public events which transpired
at that period, and which will ever be regarded as among
the most remarkable in modern history.</p>

<p>I have told you how Louis Napoleon, in consequence
of the Revolution of 1848, became President of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Republic. When I arrived in Paris, in April, 1851, he
was officiating in that capacity, his residence being the
little palace of the Elysée Bourbon, situated between the
Faubourg St. Honoré and the Champs Elysées. The
National Assembly, consisting of seven hundred and fifty
members, held their sessions at the building called the
Chamber of Deputies. The Government had been in
operation somewhat over two years.</p>

<p>To the casual observer, the external aspect of things
was not very different from what it had been under the
monarchy of Louis Philippe. It is true that the palace
of the Tuileries was vacant; no royal coaches were seen
dashing through the avenues; the public monuments
everywhere proclaimed "liberty, equality, fraternity."
But still, the streets were filled with soldiers as before.
Armed sentinels were stationed at the entrances of all the
public buildings. The barracks were, as usual, swarming
with soldiers, and large masses of horse and foot were
training at the Champ de Mars and at Satory. Martial
reviews and exercises were, indeed, the chief amusement
of the metropolis. The President's house was a palace,
and all around it was bristling with bayonets. It was
obvious that, whatever name the Government might bear,
military force lay at the bottom of it; and if to-day this
might be its defence, to-morrow it might also be its overthrow.</p>

<p>It is now ascertained that Louis Napoleon, from the
beginning, had his mind fixed upon the restoration of the
Empire. In accepting the presidency of the Republic,
and even in swearing fidelity to the Constitution, he considered
himself only as mounting the steps of the Imperial
throne.</p>

<p>In order to prepare the nation for the revolution which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
he meditated, Louis Napoleon caused agitating and alarming
rumors to be circulated of a terrible plot, planned by
the Democrats, Republicans, and Socialists of France, the
object of which was to overturn the whole fabric of
society, to destroy religion, to sweep away the obligations
of marriage, to strip the rich of their property, and make
a general distribution of it among the masses. Other
conspiracies, having similar designs, were said to exist in
all the surrounding countries of Europe, and the time
was now near at hand when the fearful explosion would
take place. The police of France, subject to the control
and direction of the President, were instructed to discover
evidences of this infernal plot, and they were so
successful, that the public mind was filled with a vague
but anxious apprehension that society was reposing upon
a volcano, which might soon burst forth and overwhelm
the whole country in chaos.</p>

<p>The National Assembly acted in a manner to favor
these schemes of the Presidents. They were divided
into four or five factions, and spent their time chiefly in
angry disputes and selfish intrigues. A portion of them
were monarchists; and, though they had acquired their
seats by pledges of devotion to the republic, they were
now plotting its overthrow; a part being for the restoration
of the Orleanists, and a part for the Bourbons.
Another faction was for Louis Napoleon, and actively
promoted his schemes. By the Constitution he was
ineligible for a second term, and his friends were seeking
the means of overcoming the difficulty, and giving him
a re-election, by fair means or foul. The Liberals were
divided into several shades of opinion&mdash;some being Republicans,
after the model of General Cavaignac; some
being Democrats, like Victor Hugo; and some Socialists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
after the fashion of Pierre Leroux. In such a state of
things there was a vast deal of idle debate, while the
substantial interests of the country seemed, if not totally
forgotten, at least secondary to the interests of parties,
and the passions and prejudices of individuals.</p>

<p>I remember that on a certain Monday evening, the 1st
of December, 1852, I was present at the Elysée, and was
then first introduced to Louis Napoleon. I found him to
be an ordinary-looking person, rather under size, but well
formed, and with a dull expression of countenance. The
room was tolerably full, the company consisting, as is
usual in such cases, of diplomats, military officers, and
court officials, with a sprinkling of citizens, in black
coats. I was forcibly struck by the preponderance of
soldiers in the assembly, and I said several times to my
companions that it seemed more like a camp than a
palace. The whole scene was dull; the President himself
appeared preoccupied, and was not master of his
usual urbanity; General Magnan walked from room to
room with a ruminating air, occasionally sending his
keen glances around, as if searching for something which
he could not find. There was no music&mdash;no dancing.
That gayety which almost always pervades a festive party
in Paris was wholly wanting. There was no ringing
laughter&mdash;no merry hum of conversation. I noticed all
this, but I did not suspect the cause. At eleven o'clock
the assembly broke up, and the guests departed. At
twelve, the conspirators, gathered for their several tasks,
commenced their operations.</p>

<p>About four in the morning the leading members of the
Assembly were seized in their beds, and hurried to prison.
Troops were distributed at various points, so as to secure
the city. When the light of day came, proclamations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
were posted at the corners of the streets, announcing to
the citizens that the National Assembly was dissolved;
that universal suffrage was decreed; that the Republic
was established! Such was the general unpopularity of
the Assembly, that the first impression of the people was
that of delight at its overthrow. Throughout the first
day the streets of Paris were like a swarming hive, filled
with masses of people, yet, for the most part, in good-humor.
The second day they had reflected, and began
to frown, but yet there was no general spirit of revolt.
A few barricades were attempted, but the operators were
easily dispersed. The third day came; and although
there was some agitation among the masses, there was
evidently no preparation, no combination for general resistance.
As late as ten o'clock in the forenoon I met
one of the Republicans whom I knew, and asked him
what was to be done. His reply was,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We can do nothing; our leaders are in prison; we
are bound hand and foot. I am ready to give my life at
the barricades, if with the chance of benefit; but I do
not like to throw it away. We can do nothing!"</p>

<p>Soon after this I perceived heavy columns of troops&mdash;some
four thousand men&mdash;marching through the Rue de
la Paix, and then proceeding along the Boulevards towards
the Port St. Denis. These were soon followed by
a body of about a thousand horse. I was told that
similar bodies were moving to the same point through
other avenues of the city. In a short time the whole
Boulevard, from the Rue de la Paix to the Place de la
Bastille, an extent of two miles, was filled with troops.
My office was on the Boulevard des Italiens, and was
now fronted by a dense body of lancers, each man with
his cocked pistol in his hand. Except the murmur of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
horses' hoofs, there was a general stillness over the city.
The side-walks were filled with people; and though there
was no visible cause for alarm, yet there was still a vague
apprehension which cast pallor and gloom upon the faces
of all.</p>

<p>Suddenly a few shots were heard in the direction of
the Boulevard Montmartre, and then a confused hum, and
soon a furious clatter of hoofs. A moment after, the
whole body of horse started into a gallop, and rushed
by as if in flight; presently they halted, however,
wheeled slowly, and gradually moved back, taking up
their former position. The men looked keenly at the
houses on either side, and pointed their pistols threateningly
at all whom they saw at the windows. It afterward
appeared, that when the troops had been drawn out in
line and stationed along the Boulevard, some half-dozen
shots were fired into them from the tops of buildings and
from windows: this created a sudden panic; the troops
ran, and, crowding upon others, caused the sudden movement
I have described. In a few moments the heavy,
sickening sound of muskets came from the Porte St.
Denis. Volley succeeded volley, and after some time the
people were seen rushing madly along the pavements of
the Boulevard, as if to escape. The gate of our hôtel
was now closed, and, at the earnest request of the throng
that had gathered for shelter in the court of the hôtel, I
put out the "Stars and Stripes"&mdash;the first and last time
that I ever deemed it necessary. The dull roar of muskets,
with the occasional boom of cannon, continued at
intervals for nearly half-an-hour. Silence at last succeeded,
and the people ventured into the streets.</p>

<p>About four in the afternoon I walked for a mile along
the Boulevard. The pavements were strewn with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
fragments of shattered windows, broken cornices, and
shivered doorways. Many of the buildings, especially
those on the southern side of the street, were thickly
spattered with bullet-marks, especially around the windows.
One edifice was riddled through and through with
cannon-shot. Frequent spots of blood stained the sidewalk,
and along the Boulevard Montmartre, particularly
around the doorways, there were pools like those of the
shambles; it being evident that the reckless soldiers had
shot down in heaps the fugitives who, taken by surprise,
strove to obtain shelter at the entrances of the hôtels
upon the street.</p>

<p>The morning came, and the triumph of the Reign of
Terror was complete. What was enacted in Paris was
imitated all over France. Nearly every department was
declared in a state of siege; revolt was punished with
death, and doubt or hesitation with imprisonment. Forty
thousand persons were hurried to the dungeons, without
even the form or pretence of trial. All over the country
the press was silenced, as it had been in Paris; save
only a few obsequious prints, which published what was
dictated to them. These declared that all this bloodshed
and violence were the necessary result of the Socialist
conspiracy, which threatened to overturn society; happily,
as they contended, Louis Napoleon, like a beneficent
Providence, had crushed the monster, and he now asked
the people to ratify what he had done, by making him
President for ten years. In the midst of agitation, delusion,
and panic, the vote was taken, and Louis Napoleon
was elected by a vote of eight millions of suffrages!
The nominal Republic thus established soon gave way to
the Empire; the President reached the Imperial throne,
and now stands before the world as Napoleon III.!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>Since his acquisition of a throne Louis Napoleon has
conducted the government with ability, and he has certainly
been seconded by fortune. He married a lady who
has shed lustre upon her high position by her gentle virtues
and gracious manners. He engaged in the Eastern
War, and triumphed. He has greatly improved and embellished
the capital, and made Paris the most charming
city in the world: nowhere else does life seem to flow on
so cheerfully and so tranquilly as here. He has gradually
softened the rigors of his government; and though some
noble spirits still pine in exile, he has taken frequent advantage
of opportunity to diminish the number. The
people of France, at the present time, appear to be satisfied
with the government, and, no doubt, a large majority,
could the question be proposed to them, would vote for
its continuance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the summer of 1853, I was politely advised from
the State Department that President Pierce had appointed
my successor in the consulate. Thus, having held the
place a little over two years, on the 1st of August, 1853,
I was restored to the privileges of private-citizen life. As
I had various engagements which forbade me immediately
to leave France, I hired a small house at Courbevoie,
which I made my residence till my departure for America.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1854 I set out with my family for a
short tour in Italy. In all my wanderings I had never
visited this famous country; and as I was not likely ever
to have another opportunity, I felt it to be a kind of duty
to avail myself of a few unappropriated weeks to accomplish
this object. After visiting Florence, Rome, and
Naples, we returned to Paris. Tarrying there for a short
time, for the purpose of seeing the International Exhibition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of 1855, we finally left Europe in October, and in
the next month found a new home in New York.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have now come to my farewell. Leave-takings are
in general somewhat melancholy, and it is best to make
them as brief as possible. Mine shall consist of a single
train of thought, and that suggestive of cheerful rather
than mournful feelings. Like a traveller approaching the
end of his journey, I naturally cast a look backward, and
surveying the monuments which rise up in the distance,
seek to estimate the nature and tendency of the march
of events which I have witnessed, and in which I have
participated.</p>

<p>One general remark appears to me applicable to the
half century over which my observation has extended;
which is, that everywhere there has been improvement.
I know of no department of human knowledge, no sphere
of human inquiry, no race of men, no region of the earth,
where there has been retrogression. On the whole, the
age has been alike fruitful in discovery, and in the practical,
beneficial results of discovery. Science has advanced
with giant strides; and it is the distinguishing characteristic
of modern science that it is not the mere toy of the
philosopher, nor the hidden mystery of the laboratory,
but the hard-working servant of the manufactory, the
workshop, and the kitchen.</p>

<p>On every hand are the evidences of improvement.
What advances have been made in agriculture; in the
analysis of soils, the preparation of manures, the improvement
of implements, from the spade to the steam-reaper;
in the manufacture of textile fabrics by the inventions of
Jacquard and others in weaving, and innumerable devices
in spinning; in the working of iron&mdash;cutting, melting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
moulding, rolling, shaping it like dough, whereby it
is applied to a thousand new uses; in commerce and navigation,
by improved models of ships, improved chronometers,
barometers, and quadrants&mdash;in chain-pumps and
wheel-rudders; in printing, by the use of the steam-press,
throwing off a hundred thousand impressions instead
of two thousand in a day; in microscopes, which
have revealed new worlds in the infinity of littleness, as
well as in telescopes, which have unfolded immeasurable
depths of space before hidden from the view. How
has travelling been changed, from jolting along at the
rate of six miles an hour over rough roads in a stage-coach,
to putting one's self comfortably to bed in a
steamboat and going fifteen miles an hour; or sitting
down in a railway-carriage to read a novel, and before
you have finished it to find yourself two hundred miles
away!</p>

<p>And in the moral world, the last fifty years appear
to me to have shown an improvement, if not as marked,
yet as certain and positive, as in the material world.
Everywhere, as I believe, the standard of humanity is
more elevated than before. If in some things, with the
increase of wealth and luxury, we have degenerated, on
the whole there has been an immense advance, as well
in technical morals as in those large humanities which
aim at the good of all mankind.</p>

<p>In looking at the political condition of our country,
there are no doubt threatening clouds in the sky and
mutterings of ominous thunders in the distance. I have,
however, known such things before; I have seen the
country shaken to its centre by the fierce collision of
parties, and the open assaults of the spirit of disunion.
But these dangers passed away. Within my memory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the states of the Union have been doubled in number,
and the territory of the Union has been trebled in
extent. This I have seen; and as such has been the
fact, so may be, and so I trust will be, the future.
Farewell!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>

<p class="p2 center">THE DEATH OF PETER PARLEY.</p>

<p class="center">
<cite>From the London Welcome Guest.</cite><br />
</p>

<p>Friend of my youth! Delightful instructor of my
early days! Thou kindly soul, who labored so patiently
to expand my unopened mind, and inspire it with a becoming
interest in the world in which it had but lately
awakened! Benevolent traveller, who led my innocence
gently by the hand through all the countries of the
earth, and chatted intelligibly with me of their strangely
varying customs, their wonderful histories, their diverse
climates, and productions, and capacities! Thou that,
in the first budding of my young ideas, pointed out to
me the glories of the starry night, and the marvels of the
vasty deep; that couldst sympathize with my untaught
childhood, and adapt thy immeasurable learning to its
little wants, and powers, and likings, and intertwine thy
omniscient narrative with absorbing adventures that enthralled
its whole soul, and thrilled its wondering bosom,
and upraised the hairs that as yet but thinly covered its
tender pate! May my right hand forget its cunning,
thou large-hearted benefactor, if I permit thee to pass
away into Hades all unheralded! That stingy paragraph
in a print that is read to-day and handed into oblivion
to-morrow, is no meed worthy of thee, Peter Parley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Thou meritest a more bounteous memorial. Thy name
is known far and wide; and countless eyes, as they read
in these pages that thou hast entered the Land of
Shadows, shall be dimmed with grateful recollection.</p>

<p>If it may be allowed a copy of the <span class="smcap">Welcome Guest</span>
to journey beyond the postal arrangements of this
world, and to meet the disembodied eyes of the other
one, I wish that the concession may be made to this current
number, and that it may be placed in Peter Parley's
hands, as he sits in honor amid his new fellows. Then
shall his gentle shade rejoice to know that we, his children,
who used to gather around his knees, so to say,
when he was still in the flesh, many long years since, are
not ungrateful for his care of us, but cherish a most fond
remembrance of it!</p>

<p>It was but last May the hand that had written so
pleasantly and so usefully grew chill, and the pen fell
from its unnerved grasp. No fresh travels of Peter
Parley shall we have reported to us. Whatever his
journeyings may not be&mdash;however weirdly novel, and
thrilling, and strange&mdash;we cannot hope for any record of
them. No sojourner in that land has ever yet returned
to give us his account of it. No pencillings by the way,
no fine descriptions of landscape or people, no notes of
its ways and manners, ever reach us from the other side
of the dividing river. So Peter Parley will observe and
record for us never again.</p>

<p>Which of Peter Parley's numerous writings did you
give the preference to, my reader? There was a capital
story about a sailor boy in the <cite>Tales of the Sea</cite>, if you
remember. To me that young Crusoe endeared the whole
volume. I confess the facts with which every page was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
stored have escaped me somewhat; but oh! how well
I recollect the sailor boy!</p>

<p>Do you remember that picture which served as the
frontispiece of the <cite>Tales of the Stars</cite>? There was old
Peter himself, with a crowd of us&mdash;his curly-headed
darlings&mdash;all round him. The stars, if my memory
serves me, are shining with unwonted brightness upon
the interesting group, and upon a celestial globe which
occupies the left side of the scene. If my memory
serves me, I say; but ay me! the lapse of many years
has much impaired it, I fear, and the vision I call before
me of that primeval period, is somewhat a broken and
fragmentary one.</p>

<p>I cannot stay to mention all the members of the
library with which Peter Parley and our governess, acting
with a sweet consent, supplied us. There were some
pleasant passages in the <cite>Tales of Animals</cite>. I still vividly
remember the panther and the lion, which appeared upon
that stage. I cannot say why I remember them above
all others, any more than I can say why many things
connected with my early youth have remained in my
memory, whilst a thousand other incidents of equal importance
have vanished utterly from it. All I know is,
that I especially remember the panther and the lion in
Mr. Parley's famous zoological work.</p>

<p>But, in my opinion, Peter Parley's most triumphant
effusion&mdash;his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>&mdash;the work on which his fame
will undoubtedly rest in the judgment of an admiring
posterity of infants&mdash;the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne plus ultra</i> of his great
powers, in which the astonishing grace of his style
reaches its highest perfection, and his knowledge is surpassed
only by the facility and the kindliness with which
he imparts it&mdash;his crowning effort is&mdash;need I name it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Shall I not be accused of penning truisms? Of course I
mean his <cite>Travels through Europe, Asia, Africa, and
America</cite>.</p>

<p>Let that be a red-lettered day in my calendar when
I entered upon those travels. Blessed be the dear
maternal hand that gave them to me! Once more,
standing by <em>her</em> side&mdash;the kind hand the while, I doubt
not, smoothing my roughened locks, the gentle tongue
patiently helping my tardy utterance&mdash;I spell out the
opening chapters. Gather round me now, O pleasant
company, into which I was then introduced. Be seated
again at thy round table, O Parley! with those delightful
guests around thee, and let me listen to thy wonderful
stories. Be present with me, ye shades. If, O Pluto!
thou hast them in thy keeping, I pray thee to grant them
a brief furlough, that I may know them once more.</p>

<p>Come, O Jenkins! bravest of men; come in that pea-green
jacket, in which thou presentest thyself to the
astonished Parley at the end of the travels in Europe.
'Tis a bleak night, and Parley, resting by his blazing fire
from all his Continental labors, thinks, good soul! of his
absent friends, and of course of thee, Jenkins. Presently
a knock is heard at the door, and Parley, answering it&mdash;he
kept no lounging John Thomases in his unostentatious
establishment&mdash;beholds a pea-green jacket. Enters the
jacket, and shakes itself. Wonders the simple Parley,
not having the remotest idea, you know, who this intruding
garment is. Can it be?&mdash;yes of course, it is&mdash;Jenkins.
Is not that a grand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">denouement</i>? I say the
recognition of Orestes by Electra, in the Greek play, so
much bragged about by the Scholiasts and that lot, is not
fit to hold a candle to it, to speak metaphorically. Is it
not Jenkins that I see in Asia, defending himself stoutly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
in the midst of an arid plain, against a mounted Arab?
The child of the desert is urging his barb straight upon
the brave fellow. Hard by may be seen a small fire of
sticks, which our hungry but injudicious friend has
kindled, with a view to cooking him a mutton chop, or
some such dainty. My wishes are for thy welfare,
Jenkins! My blessings on thy valor, incomparable man!</p>

<p>That is Leo, I think, that I see in such a heartrending
condition on board, or rather on the boards of yonder
wreck, while the omnipresent genius of Peter Parley is
being tossed in wave-blankets some little way off. Yes, I
know him; that <em>is</em> Leo. Parley, the chivalrous Parley,
saves his life upon that occasion, and earns his lasting
gratitude. I doubt whether Leo's character will bear
investigation; he comes to great grief in the end. But
I like him for his grateful services to his deliverer; and I
like him for the mysterious air there is about him, and
for his thrilling adventures. He wanders all over the
world in a black mantle, nobody knows why; at least I
do not, and have no desire to know. I suppose he found
a secret satisfaction in roaming everywhere inside that
cloak, and that is enough for me. There are three
pictures in the whole work that I feel an intense interest
in; and one has to do with Leo. It is when he escapes
from that prison built into the lake; just as the prisoner
of Chillon would have been overjoyed to escape, had he
had the knack and vigor of our hero. The particular
scene of the act which the delightful artist (what was <em>his</em>
name? which are his pictures in the National Gallery?)
has been good enough to delineate, is our Jack Shepherd
holding on to his prison-window by the only remaining
bar. Of course he is accompanied by the cloak, which
the breezes of the night are swelling into a globular form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Some dozen feet below the cloak, sparkles in the moonlight
the water, into which the fugitive proposes to drop,
as soon as the artist has done with him. 'Tis a dismal
prospect for thee, Leo. May the daughters of the lake
bear up thy chin! I have a fond belief that he is not
to be drowned at present. We are only in Asia now,
and we shall want him many a time yet in the other two
quarters.</p>

<p>Who is that sailor I see crouching on that bank?
Above his head is a most truculent-looking tiger; below
him is an infuriated crocodile. Do you talk to me of
dramatic effect, Aristarchus, in those tomes you are
always maudling over? I defy you and your tribe, sirrah,
to produce me a situation so breath-stopping, so
blood-chilling, so every way effective, as the opening scene
of Asia. That is a good hit in the Winter's Tale, by a
play-wright called Shakspeare, when "exit Antigonus,
pursued by a bear." But can it be compared&mdash;I appeal
to all unprejudiced infants&mdash;with that first chapter of our
Second Expedition? Was ever a mortal in so dire an
extremity? Scylla and Charybdis, to my mind, are a
joke to it. But Parley rescues him, and without any of
your <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dei ex machina</i>; though, if there ever was a knot
that seemed to require a Deity's fingers for its unravelling,
this surely was it. Of course, he rescues him; for it is
not Parley's way, whatever other people may do, to hurl
his valiant souls prematurely into Hades, and make them
a prey to dogs and vultures.</p>

<p>I have said that there were three pictures in the Travels
that especially entranced me, and I have mentioned one
of them. Now for the other two. The first represents
the famous Parley himself, the English Herodotus, playing
with a spider in that unwholesome dungeon at Tripoli.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Poor Parley! He had his little troubles now and
then. There can be no doubt that he is in a tremendous
scrape at this time. But his genial temper is unruffled;
he makes friends at once with his tiny fellow-tenant, and
I dare say is, even now, meditating some Tales of Insects
for your and my benefit. He reminds me rather of Goldsmith,
making observations for his History of the Earth
and Animated Nature. There is the same innocence,
the same benignity, the same childish look of innocence
about him. I have no doubt the spider is become much
attached to him. I lisp out my good wishes for thee,
thou even-minded captive. I place my small palm upon thy
unkempt head, and bless thee. We are not kept long in
suspense about him. A night soon arrives when Leo's
cloak insinuates itself into his cell, and a voice is heard
in its folds saying, "Follow me," and Parley follows, even
as St. Peter followed the angel, and they reach a wharf,
and fire a pistol, and a boat pulls in to the shore, and
they embark in it, and Parley is once more a free man,
and addresses himself afresh to his travels.</p>

<p>My last wood-cut portrays this indefatigable wanderer
a second time oppressed by the hard fates. He is in
America this time, and by some misfortune (a great good
fortune to me and to you, my young brethren and sisters
of the nursery) has been made the prey of an Indian
tribe. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Me miserum!</i> The savages have tied him to a
tree. There are those hands that have guided that immortal
pen through Europe, Asia, and Africa, corded
stringently to a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triste lignum</i> in America! There he
stands, denuded of his raiment, and with a writhing expression
all over him; for the sportive innocents of the
tribe are amusing their leisure hours by shooting their
youthful arrows at him. Yes; they are making a target<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
of poor P. P. O! my fellow-students, think what this
great heart suffers for us! During all that agony he is
gathering information for our benefit, is writing for us
another incomparable chapter, is taking stock of yonder
wigwams.</p>

<p>But the page is growing indistinct before me, and I
hear voices saluting me from the nursery, not as a child,
but as a veteran. Can it be? No; impossible! And
Peter Parley and his brave company recede mournfully
to their land, wherever it is, and my hair is a trifle grey,
or that mirror lies.</p>

<p>Farewell, my good Peter. Fare ye well, my stout
Jenkins, my mysterious Leo, and all ye other fine fellows.
I rejoice to have met you once more, and to have spent
a pleasant hour with you, and talked over our old companionship.</p>
